Revolution</p><p>10. b.24 hours</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. It takes Earth longer to revolve around the sun than to rotate on its axis</p><p>2. The apparent motion of the sun, caused by the rotation of the Earth about its axis, changes the angle at which the direct component of light will strike the Earth. From a fixed location on Earth, the sun appears to move throughout the sky.</p><p>3. 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.0916 seconds</p><p>It only takes 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.0916 seconds for the Earth to turn once its axis.</p><p>4. The Earth orbits the sun once every 365 days and rotates about its axis once every 24 hours. Day and night are due to the Earth rotating on its axis, not its orbiting around the sun. The term 'one day' is determined by the time the Earth takes to rotate once on its axis and includes both day time and night time.</p><p>5. Today, instead of rotating upright, the Earth's axis is tilted 23.5 degrees. ... The Earth's axis always points the same direction, so as the planet makes its way around the sun, each hemisphere sees varying amounts of sunlight.</p><p>6. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, latitudes between the equator and 90°N (the North Pole) are experiencing summer. At the same time, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun and experiencing winter.</p><p>7. March Equinox</p><p>March Equinox - Equal Day and Night, Nearly. There are two equinoxes every year, in March and September, when the Sun shines directly on the equator, and the length of night and day are nearly equal.</p><p>8. 29 days</p><p>In an ordinary year, if you were to count all the days in a calendar from January to December, you'd count 365 days. But approximately every four years, February has 29 days instead of 28. So, there are 366 days in the year. This is called a leap year.</p><p>9. Earth spins around its axis, just as a top spins around its spindle. This spinning movement is called Earth's rotation. At the same time that the Earth spins on its axis, it also orbits, or revolves around the Sun. This movement is called revolution.</p><p>10. Earth's rotation</p><p>At any given moment, we are all moving at a speed of about 1,674 kilometers an hour, thanks to the Earth's rotation, By definition, the Earth's rotation is the amount of time that it takes to rotate once on its axis. This is, apparently, accomplished once a day – i.e. every 24 hours.</p><p></p><p>sana makatulong:)</p><br />
