His brothers and sisters were all red. They lived in a corner of the sea. One bad day, a very hungry tuna fish came swimming fast through the waves. He swallowed all the little red fish. Swimmy escaped from the big mouth of the tuna fish Swimmy was scared, lonely and very sad. As he swam away, he saw many wonderful creatures-lobsters, eels and sea anemones that looked like pink palm trees swaying in the wind. Watching them made Swimmy happy again.Swimmy continued to swim. Down under a rocky corner, he saw a school of little fish, just like his own. "Why are you hiding down there? Let's go swim, play, and see things!" he said happily. "We can't," said the little red fish. "The big fish will eat us all." "But you can't just be there," said Swimmy. "We must do something". "What can we do?" asked the little red fish. Swimmy thought and thought and thought. Then suddenly he said, "I have an idea!" "We are going to swim altogether like the biggest fish in the sea!" He taught the little red fish to swim close together. When they had learned to swim like one giant fish, he said, "I'll be the eye." And they swam in the cool morning water and in the midday sun and chased the big fish away.Directions: Complete the graphic organizer about the story, Swimmy. 1. Title: 2. Setting: 3. Hero:4-6.

                                            The Golden Fish Acts WiselyUpon a certain island in the middle of the sea lived a fisherman and his wife. Theywere so poor they often went without bread when the fishing did not go well.One day the man caught a small golden fish who begged to be let go. Because theman did let him go, the little fish promised that he would come back if the fisherman everneeded help. The man said that he and his wife had no food, and when the man returnedhome there was a nice meal on the table. But the fisherman's wife was greedy.After she ate the nice meal, she went to bed planning what they should demand fromthe golden fish next. She woke up early the next morning and shook her husband awake.“Wake up, you lazy man! Go and tell your fish that I need a new washtub!” So he went andcalled to the golden fish again, and when he returned home there was a beautiful newwashtub in the yard.Each day the fisherman's wife had a new demand. And each one was granted. Thefisherman's wife got a big new house, beautiful new clothes, servants to do her work, and ahorse-drawn carriage to ride in. But the fisherman did not enjoy the new things, and he wasashamed of his greedy wife. She was rude to the servants, and she was too busy thinking upnew demands to speak to her husband.Once again, she demanded that he call the golden fish. She wanted to be Queen ofthe Waters. “Make your wife Queen of the Waters?” exclaimed the golden fish. That is thelast thing I should do. She is unfit to rule. She cannot even rule herself. I shall make her apoor woman again. Goodbye! You will see me no more.”With great sorrow and dread, the fisherman went home to tell his wife the news. Tohis surprise, the big house had been transformed into their little old cabin, and his wife wasclothed in rags. Life was much easier for the fisherman after that. His wife had learned theresults of greed. She planted a little garden, to provide food when the fishing did not go well.Sometimes when the fisherman drew in his line, the sun glinted on the scales of hiscatch, and he had a moment's hope of seeing his little friend again. But that was never tocome to pass.                 "Story Map"Setting:characters: Plot Beginning:Middle:Ending:Theme:So sorry if this was long Nonsense = Report ​</a>

His brothers and sisters were all red. They lived in a corner of the sea. One bad day, a very hungry tuna fish came swimming fast through the waves. He swallowed all the little red fish. Swimmy escaped from the big mouth of the tuna fish Swimmy was scared, lonely and very sad. As he swam away, he saw many wonderful creatures-lobsters, eels and sea anemones that looked like pink palm trees swaying in the wind. Watching them made Swimmy happy again.Swimmy continued to swim. Down under a rocky corner, he saw a school of little fish, just like his own. "Why are you hiding down there? Let's go swim, play, and see things!" he said happily. "We can't," said the little red fish. "The big fish will eat us all." "But you can't just be there," said Swimmy. "We must do something". "What can we do?" asked the little red fish. Swimmy thought and thought and thought. Then suddenly he said, "I have an idea!" "We are going to swim altogether like the biggest fish in the sea!" He taught the little red fish to swim close together. When they had learned to swim like one giant fish, he said, "I'll be the eye." And they swam in the cool morning water and in the midday sun and chased the big fish away.Directions: Complete the graphic organizer about the story, Swimmy. 1. Title: 2. Setting: 3. Hero:4-6.

                            22. The Golden Fish Acts WiselyUpon a certain island in the middle of the sea lived a fisherman and his wife. Theywere so poor they often went without bread when the fishing did not go well.One day the man caught a small golden fish who begged to be let go. Because theman did let him go, the little fish promised that he would come back if the fisherman everneeded help. The man said that he and his wife had no food, and when the man returnedhome there was a nice meal on the table. But the fisherman's wife was greedy.After she ate the nice meal, she went to bed planning what they should demand fromthe golden fish next. She woke up early the next morning and shook her husband awake.“Wake up, you lazy man! Go and tell your fish that I need a new washtub!” So he went andcalled to the golden fish again, and when he returned home there was a beautiful newwashtub in the yard.Each day the fisherman's wife had a new demand. And each one was granted. Thefisherman's wife got a big new house, beautiful new clothes, servants to do her work, and ahorse-drawn carriage to ride in. But the fisherman did not enjoy the new things, and he wasashamed of his greedy wife. She was rude to the servants, and she was too busy thinking upnew demands to speak to her husband.Once again, she demanded that he call the golden fish. She wanted to be Queen ofthe Waters. “Make your wife Queen of the Waters?” exclaimed the golden fish. That is thelast thing I should do. She is unfit to rule. She cannot even rule herself. I shall make her apoor woman again. Goodbye! You will see me no more.”With great sorrow and dread, the fisherman went home to tell his wife the news. Tohis surprise, the big house had been transformed into their little old cabin, and his wife wasclothed in rags. Life was much easier for the fisherman after that. His wife had learned theresults of greed. She planted a little garden, to provide food when the fishing did not go well.Sometimes when the fisherman drew in his line, the sun glinted on the scales of hiscatch, and he had a moment's hope of seeing his little friend again. But that was never tocome to pass.                 "Story Map"Setting:characters: Plot Beginning:Middle:Ending:Theme:So sorry if this was long Nonsense = Report ​</h2><br />
