Holy Week is the last week of Lent and is very important in our religious calendar. On Palm Sunday, accompanied by his disciples, Jesus entered Jerusalem while people lined the streets and waved palms, leaves and olive branches. On Holy Thursday, he washed the feet of his friends. On Good Friday, he was whipped and forced to carry the heavy wooden cross to Golgotha, where he was nailed and left to die. 12. The world has experienced a prolonged period of uncertainty and unrest caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, it has already affected the lives of people in almost 200 countries globally. The human cost is rapidly being matched by huge economic costs. 13. Is the use of cellphones necessary in school? While others agree on the use of cellphones of the learners in school, many are still not in favor of the idea for a simple reason that it will only distract them from focusing on the different school activities. Banning the use of it inside the classroom is a good way of focusing on acquiring foundational learning skills that the students need. 14. Depression affects how people think, feel and act. Depression makes it more difficult to manage from day to day and interferes with study, work and relationships. A person may be depressed if for more than two weeks they have felt sad, down or miserable most of the time or have lost interest or pleasure in most of their usual activities. 15.Mayon Volcano is well-known around the world as the "perfect cone" volcano due to its almost symmetric conical shape- a unique feature. It is also the most active volcano in the Philippines, having erupted almost 50 times in the past 400 years alone. The site is also a protected landscape and a natural park. 16.Making a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) face mask has become the top stay-home activity during the novel coronavirus outbreak. The best fabric homemade masks is a tightly woven, 100% cotton fabric. First, print a pattern and cut it out. Use the pattern to cut 2 cotton fabric pieces. Place cut fabric with front sides together, sew and press seam flat to one side.​</a>

Write your answers on the blank. (2 points each) __1. One of the biggest tourist attractions in Asia is Bali, a province in Indonesia. Bali is the largest tourist destination in the country. Golden beaches, hillside terraces, flowing fields and cool green hills that harbor the highland villages are what you can see in the province of Bali with Denpasar as its capital. __2. The Fire Dance is just one of the many dances you might see in Bali. Bear in mind however, that no dance is performed for pleasure alone; each is based on a need to communicate with Gods. Naturally, you will need to visit Bali to understand why the Balines are on such good terms with Gods. __3. Three days of stay in Bali will enable you to experience all that it could offer. On the first day, you can visit the fascinating village of Celuk, and the woodcarving of Mas. Next in line is the cultural center of Bali called Ubud; with its spectacular scenery of rice paddies and river gorges, where you will marvel at the works of local artists i galleries. Finally, in the north of Bali is the village of Kintanami which should be visited at dawn to experience the spectacular sunrise over the volcanic basin of Mt. Batur where you will feel like sailing or wind surfing. __4. Ice cream is made of milk, cream and sugar. All of the ingredients are mixed together. Then the ingredients are heated up to kill off any germs. The mixture is then frozen and whipped at the same time. This makes it softer. __5. Boiling is perhaps the safest way to purify cloudy water. First, pre-filter the cloudy water, then boil it. Next, let the water cool. Meanwhile, make a cotton and charcoal filter by crushing the charcoal and putting it in the cotton as trap. Finally, filter the boiled water through the cotton trap.[tex]\bold\green{Correct-Brainlist}[/tex][tex]\bold\red{Nonsense-Report}[/tex]​</a>

                                            Directions: Read and reflect on the short essay then answer the guide questions on a separate sheet of paper.          Man as a Social Animal        By Ma. Teresa B. Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</a>

Golden beaches, hillside terraces, flowing fields and cool green hills that harbor the highland villages are what you can see in the province of Bali with Denpasar as its capital. __2. The Fire Dance is just one of the many dances you might see in Bali. Bear in mind however, that no dance is performed for pleasure alone; each is based on a need to communicate with Gods. Naturally, you will need to visit Bali to understand why the Balines are on such good terms with Gods. __3. Three days of stay in Bali will enable you to experience all that it could offer. On the first day, you can visit the fascinating village of Celuk, and the woodcarving of Mas. Next in line is the cultural center of Bali called Ubud; with its spectacular scenery of rice paddies and river gorges, where you will marvel at the works of local artists i galleries. Finally, in the north of Bali is the village of Kintanami which should be visited at dawn to experience the spectacular sunrise over the volcanic basin of Mt. Batur where you will feel like sailing or wind surfing. __4. Ice cream is made of milk, cream and sugar. All of the ingredients are mixed together. Then the ingredients are heated up to kill off any germs. The mixture is then frozen and whipped at the same time. This makes it softer. __5. Boiling is perhaps the safest way to purify cloudy water. First, pre-filter the cloudy water, then boil it. Next, let the water cool. Meanwhile, make a cotton and charcoal filter by crushing the charcoal and putting it in the cotton as trap. Finally, filter the boiled water through the cotton trap.[tex]\bold\green{Correct-Brainlist}[/tex][tex]\bold\red{Nonsense-Report}[/tex]​</h2><br />

Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Yes, I believe that man is a social animal because humans have a natural instinct to live in society with other human beings.</p><p></p><p>2. Man becomes a social animal by forming social groups with common interests and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background, and other personal qualities.</p><p></p><p>3. Human interaction is very important in building a nation because it helps people form social groups that can work together towards common goals.</p><p></p><br />
