Some people have a hard time remembering to get their loved one’s appropriate gifts on Valentine’s Day. This can lead to painfully long talks about “where the relationship stands”. Perhaps the best way to avoid these talks is by taking the moral highroad. Instead of forgetting these holidays, choose not to celebrate them. Inform your loved one that you don’t want to buy into the materialism and commercialism of these manufactured holidays. Tell that person that you want to have a relationship with them, not the marketers, and that you want to celebrate your love every day, not just one day a year. It’s a tough pitch, but if you can make the sale then you’ll be in the clear for life.
7. Summarize this paragraph in one sentence. Be specific and clearly explain the main idea.
8. An appropriate title: ____________________________________________________________________________
Sir Isaac Newton was contemplating the universe in his garden one day in 1665 when he noticed an apple fall from a tree. Newton wondered to himself, “Why should the apple always fall to the ground? Why does it not go sideways or upwards but directly toward the Earth’s center?” After much contemplation, Newton concluded that objects are pulled to the Earth through a force that he called gravity, which means heaviness in Latin. On July 5th, 1687 Newton formally expressed his law of universal gravitation in a series of books called The Principia.

By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring.

                                            II. Concept Development 
Direction: Choose the best word inside the parenthesis ( ) to complete the concept of the following statement about 
developing a plan to enhance brain functions. Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. 
1. Mind (ability, power) is one of the strongest and most useful powers you possess. 
2. Your mind mapping ability (declines, enhances) your brain functions. 
3. Left brain controls all the muscles on the right-hand side of the body and the (left, right) brain controls the left 
side. One hemisphere may be slightly dominant, as with left- or right-handedness.
4. Everybody is expected for a better and smarter brain, the reason why there is a need to enhance brain 
(development, functions). 
5. Always understand your dominant brain type, you may be able to adjust your study methods, and perhaps shape 
your schedule and coursework, to suit your own (mind, personality) type. 
6. Remember that Mind mapping is a highly effective way of getting information in and out of your brain. Mind 
mapping is a creative and logical means of (handwriting, note taking) that literally "maps out" your ideas. 
7. New Mind Maps examples were popularized by author and consultant, Tony (Buzan, Biazon).
8. Improving and following the steps in mind mapping will (guide, include) you in keeping you mind map connected 
to each other. 
9. Need to apply more recommendations in mind mapping to make the mind map (easy, hard). They are the use of 
colors, drawings, and symbols, keeping the topic label, as much as possible, short, and vary text size. 
10. Getting information such as the brain (facts, parts) and enhancing our brain functions leads to a maximum 
‘Powers of the Mind’.

                                            We respect people not because it is the right thing to do or because you need to do it, rather we co-exist with people and we recognize our similarities and differences. We accept them for who they are and we don't force to change them just to be like us. It's the same thing that they cannot do such to us. The following are just some ways to demonstrate our respect for others: 1. Respect yourself first. You cannot give what you don't have. You cannot control how others would see you but you can shape the way you see yourself. If you think that you deserve to be treated well, treat yourself well. For example, you don't allow others to abuse you physically or psychologically as there are a lot of means to stop it properly and legally. 2. Be on the lookout when your prejudice strikes. There's nothing wrong if you have an opinion or idea about the person you have just met. However, it has to be balanced with actual facts at hand. If you think that he/she is a person you cannot trust, treat the person well, the same as you treat everyone else, and just reserve your idea to yourself. We have to operate with a logical mind to be fair to other people. 3. Remember that they are also like you as a person. We have our own life and difficulties or problems. Who knows, the person you might be laughing at is suffering from depression. The man you might be trying to discredit is a victim of bullying and physical abuse. Your classmate who always cracks jokes might be trying to forget his dying father. We all have our shortcomings and we are all capable of committing mistakes. The good news is our past does not define us, so learn to keep in mind that people are always a work in progress. 4. Look at the positive side of the person. Despite the imperfections or flaws, there are good things in people that are worth celebrating. Who else does not have any flaw or mistake? We treat people with respect because that's our nature and it defines who we are and not who they are. 5. Always try to be the bigger person. Have a big room for understanding and tolerance for individual differences. Try not to let your emotion get the best of you. You may feel disheartened, angry, jealous or even disappointed with people and that's OK. However, it should not change your nature as a person and the way you relate with them. Keep in mind the insights you got from the negative experiences with other people and use these to improve your dealings with others.​</a>

                                            Activity 2. DIRECTIONS: Below are examples of explanation type of texts. Tell
what is being explained in each given text.
1. The Philippines experiences an average of 20 typhoons a year. Being
surrounded by bodies of water makes us prone to experience some weather
disturbances. The biggest contributor of the weather disturbances in our
country is the Pacific Ocean which lies on the eastern side of our country.
The vast and warm waters of the ocean can generate many weather
disturbances.
2. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the
air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high-
pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As
the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds.
The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is
a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to
weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low
pressure system.
3. Weather disturbances are devastating. They can cause damage to our life
and properties. Heavy winds can destroy power and communication lines.
Roads and bridges are also damaged due to heavy rainfall and flooding.
Weather disturbances can also destroy our means of livelihood. Heavy rain
and strong winds can uproot trees and destroy crops that provide us with
food. Therefore, there is always food shortage when there is a typhoon.

4. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population
increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts.
Forest lands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for
housing and furniture. As their natural habitat diminished, so did the
population of the tamaraws, eagles and other animals.
5. Elephants are extremely intelligent animals. They have long memories. This
memory serves the mother well during dry seasons when they need to guide
their herds to even distant watering holes that they remember from the past.
They also display signs of grief, joy, anger, and play. (Source: Joy in Learning

                                            Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

Many of you must feel robbed as we are al stuck in our homes forced to deal with at that is happening from a distance The pandemic has brought our lives to a halt like nothing else could competing to imagine our world anew. How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort.

                                            Read the story carefully and do the tasks that follow.WHY DOGS WAG THEIR TAILS(Excerpt: First of Two Parts)(An Adaptation)(1) Once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a rich man who had a pet dog andcat. His only daughter whom he adored so much was living in a place several miles away fromhim. It was his custom to send his dog and cat to her daughter and bring her a present. Thedog was a bit old and had pretty much lost some teeth so he was no longer able to fight. But, healways knew how to find the way. The cat on the other hand was strong and shrewd so theycould help the other.(2) One day the rich man wanted to send a magic ring to his daughter. He called the dobgand cat. He said to the cat " You have shown a lot of character such as being shrewd andprudent so you may carry this magic ring to my daughter but you have to make sure to takegreat care of it." He also said to the dog You are to go with the cat to take this magic ring to mydaughter. Take care not to lose the way and be sure that no one bothers the cat'. Both animalspromised to do their best and went on their way.(3) On the way, they were impelled to cross a wide and deep river. They weredetermined to swim across as there was no bridge and they couldn't find a boat. The dog said tothe cat, "You need to hand me the ring;" "Oh no!", replied the cat. "Did you not remember whatthe master said just what each of us had to do?", "Yes, but you are not very good at swimmingso I can better take good care of it." The cat refused to disobey the master until the dogthreatened to kill the cat. He was left with no choice but to hand over the magic ring.(4) They began swimming but the current was so strong. It took them an hour in gettingover so they were both tired and weak. Just as they were about to come to the other side, thedog accidentally dropped the ring into the water and finding it seems impossible. The cat saidNow, we have to go back home and tell our master that we lost the ring". "Yes" answered thedog, "but I am scared". So they went back home. As they drew near the house the dog's fearOverpowered him that he ran away as fast as he could and was never seen again.(5) The master, surprised to see the cat back so soon, asked " Why are you alone?".The cat was a bit scared to answer at first. Where is the dog?" asked the master again, "Oh! Heran away' replied the cat. "Ran away?" said the master, "What do you mean? "Where is thering? Let me tell you what happened but please do not get angry"(5) When we reached the river bank, the doq asked me to hand him the ring, I refused alot of times but he threatened to kill me so I was left with no choice. The current was so strongand we were having a hard time crossing the river; so, on the way the dog dropped the ring andwe couldn't find it anymore"T told the dog to go back and tell you what happened, but he said he was so scaredthat he ran away as fast as he could".(8) With this, the master made a proclamation that whoever finds his old dog and canbring him back will be rewarded. The dog'can easily Be recognized às he was already old andhas no teeth. The master had also declared that the dog will be punished by cutting off his tail.(9) It was ordered that all the dogs shall take part in the search. Eversince, that time,when one dog meets another, he always says, "Are you the old dog who lost the ring?". If youwere that dog, your tail will be cut off. Then both the dogs show their teeth and wag their tailswhich means no. It was also that time when cats have been afraid of water.​</a>

1. Pie charts are perfect when you want to bring statistics to life.
2. To write a summary of survey results, remember that the introduction needs to
get the reader's attention.
3. Your survey summary should give the reader a complete overview of the
content.
4. Tables are a great way to share numerical data.
5. Avoid combining visuals with text will not create a thorough description of your
findings
6. Conclusion explains the truth--why the hypothesis was accurate or not.
7. Summarize the experiment procedure followed. It should be detailed and
include diagrams to support the procedure whenever possible.
8. Explain the results that were obtained from the project. Describe if they
matched your expectations or not. If the desired results were not obtained, explain how and
why the results are different.
9. You should not assume that your reader has any special knowledge of your
experiment
10. When writing the report of an experiment, it is not necessary that
you include
what is relevant to your problem.
11. Remember that observation is more than just seeing and hearing. You should
use your senses, you will be listening sounds, smelling scents, feeling sensations, watching
scenarios and even tasting food if this applies.
12. Always look for the meaning of the actions you observe.
13. Always put the analysis and interpretations of your observations within the
larger context of the theories and issues you described in the introduction.
14. Explain what observations mean to you and what they might mean to the
potential reader. Combine everything together in a concise paragraph.
15. Do record your observation randomly on what do.</a>

Write Yes if you agree with the concept conveyed, and writeNo if you disagree with it.1. Mind power is one of the strongest and most useful powers you possess.2. Your mind mapping ability may not enhance your brain functions.3. Left brain controls all the muscles on the right-hand side of the body andthe right brain controls the left side. One hemisphere may be slightly dominant, as with left- or right-handedness.4. Everybody is not expected for a better and smarter brain, the reason why there is no need to enhance brain functions.5. Always understand your dominant brain type, you may be able to adjust your study methods, and perhaps shape your schedule and coursework, to suit your own personality type.6. Remember that mind mapping is a highly effective way of losing information in and out of your brain. Mind mapping is not in any way acreative and logical means of note taking and note-making that literally "maps out" your ideas.7. New Mind Maps examples were popularized by author and consultant, Tony Buzan.8. Improving and following the steps in mind mapping will guide your mind map connected to each other.9. Need to apply more recommendations in mind mapping to make the mindmap easy. They are the use of colors, drawings, and symbols, keeping the topic label, as much as possible, short, and vary text size.10.

                                            1. The Philippines experiences an average of 20 typhoons a year. Being surrounded by bodies of water makes us prone to experience some weather disturbances. The biggest contributor of the weather disturbances in our country is the Pacific Ocean which lies on the eastern side of our country. The vast and warm waters of the ocean can generate many weather disturbances.
2. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high-pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low pressure system.
3. Weather disturbances are devastating. They can cause damage to our life and properties. Heavy winds can destroy power and communication lines. Roads and bridges are also damaged due to heavy rainfall and flooding. Weather disturbances can also destroy our means of livelihood. Heavy rain and strong winds can uproot trees and destroy crops that provide us with food. Therefore, there is always food shortage when there is a typhoon. (Source: Science Beyond Borders)
4. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts. Forest lands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for housing and furniture. As their natural habitat diminished, so did the population of the tamaraws, eagles and other animals.
5. Elephants are extremely intelligent animals. They have long memories. This memory serves the mother well during dry seasons when they need to guide their herds to even distant watering holes that they remember from the past. They also display signs of grief, joy, anger, and play.</a>

Many years ago, there was a small family in Japan. There lived a father, mother
and their little daughter. They took their daughter to the temple when she was only
thirty days old wearing a long kimono like all Japanese babies do. The parents gave
the baby a set of beautiful dolls on her first doll festival, and when their daughter turned
three, she was no longer a baby but a little girl fast growing up. She was loved by her
parents very much. One day, a messenger came and brought news that the father is
needed by the Emperor to Tokyo. They haven’t had a horse so the father will need to
walk the long way. The mother and the little daughter bid farewell to the father and
promised him that they will take care of each other and will wait for him. After many
days, the father came back and brought the mother and daughter presents. The little
girl received a doll and she was very glad while the mother was amazed by the present.
It was a thing which she saw a beautiful face of a woman. The husband laughed and
told her it was a mirror and she only saw her own reflection. He told her that if she
brings a smile to the mirror, she will see a smiling face and if she didn’t it will reflect
the mirror. The wife thanked her husband and promised that she will always bring a
smiling face to the mirror. She often looked at the mirror and does what she had
promised. She would always see a happy face in it. Many years passed and she grew
tired of looking at it. She decided to give the precious gift to her daughter who grew
into a woman exactly like her mother. One day, she called the daughter and gave a
beautiful box, and the daughter was surprised of what she saw. It was the image of
her mother inside the round shiny thing. It was the image of her mother she used to
look at when she was a little girl. The mother told her to smile every time she will look
at her inside the mirror and assured her that she will smile back. For that day on, the
daughter kept the box near her. Once each year, she opened it and proved that her
mother’s words was always true. Always she saw her mother’s smiling face when she
smiles at her. The daughter always remembers to bring smiles to the thing inside the
little box, and always the smiles come back at her.

Some people have a hard time remembering to get their loved one’s appropriate gifts on Valentine’s Day. This can lead to painfully long talks about “where the relationship stands”. Perhaps the best way to avoid these talks is by taking the moral highroad. Instead of forgetting these holidays, choose not to celebrate them. Inform your loved one that you don’t want to buy into the materialism and commercialism of these manufactured holidays. Tell that person that you want to have a relationship with them, not the marketers, and that you want to celebrate your love every day, not just one day a year. It’s a tough pitch, but if you can make the sale then you’ll be in the clear for life.

Sir Isaac Newton was contemplating the universe in his garden one day in 1665 when he noticed an apple fall from a tree. Newton wondered to himself, “Why should the apple always fall to the ground? Why does it not go sideways or upwards but directly toward the Earth’s center?” After much contemplation, Newton concluded that objects are pulled to the Earth through a force that he called gravity, which means heaviness in Latin. On July 5th, 1687 Newton formally expressed his law of universal gravitation in a series of books called The Principia.

By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text?

                            8. II. Concept Development 
Direction: Choose the best word inside the parenthesis ( ) to complete the concept of the following statement about 
developing a plan to enhance brain functions. Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. 
1. Mind (ability, power) is one of the strongest and most useful powers you possess. 
2. Your mind mapping ability (declines, enhances) your brain functions. 
3. Left brain controls all the muscles on the right-hand side of the body and the (left, right) brain controls the left 
side. One hemisphere may be slightly dominant, as with left- or right-handedness.
4. Everybody is expected for a better and smarter brain, the reason why there is a need to enhance brain 
(development, functions). 
5. Always understand your dominant brain type, you may be able to adjust your study methods, and perhaps shape 
your schedule and coursework, to suit your own (mind, personality) type. 
6. Remember that Mind mapping is a highly effective way of getting information in and out of your brain. Mind 
mapping is a creative and logical means of (handwriting, note taking) that literally "maps out" your ideas. 
7. New Mind Maps examples were popularized by author and consultant, Tony (Buzan, Biazon).
8. Improving and following the steps in mind mapping will (guide, include) you in keeping you mind map connected 
to each other. 
9. Need to apply more recommendations in mind mapping to make the mind map (easy, hard). They are the use of 
colors, drawings, and symbols, keeping the topic label, as much as possible, short, and vary text size. 
10. Getting information such as the brain (facts, parts) and enhancing our brain functions leads to a maximum 
‘Powers of the Mind’.

                            10. We respect people not because it is the right thing to do or because you need to do it, rather we co-exist with people and we recognize our similarities and differences. We accept them for who they are and we don't force to change them just to be like us. It's the same thing that they cannot do such to us. The following are just some ways to demonstrate our respect for others: 1. Respect yourself first. You cannot give what you don't have. You cannot control how others would see you but you can shape the way you see yourself. If you think that you deserve to be treated well, treat yourself well. For example, you don't allow others to abuse you physically or psychologically as there are a lot of means to stop it properly and legally. 2. Be on the lookout when your prejudice strikes. There's nothing wrong if you have an opinion or idea about the person you have just met. However, it has to be balanced with actual facts at hand. If you think that he/she is a person you cannot trust, treat the person well, the same as you treat everyone else, and just reserve your idea to yourself. We have to operate with a logical mind to be fair to other people. 3. Remember that they are also like you as a person. We have our own life and difficulties or problems. Who knows, the person you might be laughing at is suffering from depression. The man you might be trying to discredit is a victim of bullying and physical abuse. Your classmate who always cracks jokes might be trying to forget his dying father. We all have our shortcomings and we are all capable of committing mistakes. The good news is our past does not define us, so learn to keep in mind that people are always a work in progress. 4. Look at the positive side of the person. Despite the imperfections or flaws, there are good things in people that are worth celebrating. Who else does not have any flaw or mistake? We treat people with respect because that's our nature and it defines who we are and not who they are. 5. Always try to be the bigger person. Have a big room for understanding and tolerance for individual differences. Try not to let your emotion get the best of you. You may feel disheartened, angry, jealous or even disappointed with people and that's OK. However, it should not change your nature as a person and the way you relate with them. Keep in mind the insights you got from the negative experiences with other people and use these to improve your dealings with others.​</h2><br />

                            11. Activity 2. DIRECTIONS: Below are examples of explanation type of texts. Tell
what is being explained in each given text.
1. The Philippines experiences an average of 20 typhoons a year. Being
surrounded by bodies of water makes us prone to experience some weather
disturbances. The biggest contributor of the weather disturbances in our
country is the Pacific Ocean which lies on the eastern side of our country.
The vast and warm waters of the ocean can generate many weather
disturbances.
2. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the
air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high-
pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As
the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds.
The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is
a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to
weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low
pressure system.
3. Weather disturbances are devastating. They can cause damage to our life
and properties. Heavy winds can destroy power and communication lines.
Roads and bridges are also damaged due to heavy rainfall and flooding.
Weather disturbances can also destroy our means of livelihood. Heavy rain
and strong winds can uproot trees and destroy crops that provide us with
food. Therefore, there is always food shortage when there is a typhoon.

4. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population
increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts.
Forest lands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for
housing and furniture. As their natural habitat diminished, so did the
population of the tamaraws, eagles and other animals.
5. Elephants are extremely intelligent animals. They have long memories. This
memory serves the mother well during dry seasons when they need to guide
their herds to even distant watering holes that they remember from the past.
They also display signs of grief, joy, anger, and play. (Source: Joy in Learning

                            14. Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Introduction:<p>In her essay "Respect Begets Respect", Aruna Ladva emphasizes the importance of giving respect to all individuals, regardless of their actions, because every person is worthy of respect simply because they exist.</p><p></p>Body:<p>The author argues that respect is an innate quality that we possess, and we should not have to make an effort to give it. However, it is crucial to have self-respect before giving respect to others. Self-respect helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others and to build our sense of self from the inside. The author also notes that when we love and respect ourselves, we can see the beauty and specialties of others, making it easier to give respect and create harmony.</p><p></p>Idea 1:<p>According to the author, respect is not only for those who deserve it but for everyone. To give respect to all individuals, even those who do not measure up to our standards, is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect reflects more on us than the person in front of us. Waiting for others to become deserving or withholding respect until we feel they are worthy deprives us of exercising this quality, which is a valuable treasure.</p><p></p>Idea 2:<p>The author suggests that we are beings of love and that we should not seek love, approval, or regard from others because we already possess it within ourselves. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others. A person with self-respect understands that comparing or competing with others is futile and nonsensical. Comparing and competing are symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum.</p><p></p>Idea 3:<p>Lastly, the author believes that each one of us came onto this earth to share a particular quality with the world. Therefore, it is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others, even when it is not readily apparent. Giving respect to others is a way of exercising and multiplying our quality of respect, which will inevitably earn us respect from others.</p><p></p>Conclusion:<p>In conclusion, giving respect to all individuals is crucial, and it is an innate quality that we possess. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others, and it helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others. By looking for the beauty and specialties in others, we can exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will naturally earn us respect from others.</p><p></p>Reflection:<p>After reading the essay, I learned that respect is not something that we have to earn but something that we should give freely to all individuals. Self-respect is crucial because it forms the foundation for giving respect to others. Comparing and competing with others are futile and nonsensical, and they stem from a fragile, inflated ego. It is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others to exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will earn us respect from others naturally.</p><p></p><p></p><strong>#</strong><strong>CarryOnLearning</strong><strong>#</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><br />

Many of you must feel robbed as we are al stuck in our homes forced to deal with at that is happening from a distance The pandemic has brought our lives to a halt like nothing else could competing to imagine our world anew. How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort. When the fateful plane crash took the life of my husband.

Because of the detachment of the definition, it is workable for writing, for example, include stories to be viewed as <strong>creative writing</strong>, despite the fact that they fall under reporting, on the grounds that the substance of highlights is explicitly centered around story and character improvement. Both anecdotal and non-anecdotal works fall into this classification, including such structures as books, accounts, brief tales, and sonnets. In the scholarly setting, <strong>creative writing</strong> is regularly isolated into fiction and verse classes, with an emphasis on writing in a unique style, instead of impersonating prior classifications like wrongdoing or awfulness. <strong>Creative Writing</strong> for the screen and stage screenwriting and play writing are frequently educated independently, however fit under the <strong>creative writing </strong>class too.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>What Is Creative Writing?</strong> Read more

Read the story carefully and do the tasks that follow.WHY DOGS WAG THEIR TAILS(Excerpt: First of Two Parts)(An Adaptation)(1) Once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a rich man who had a pet dog andcat. His only daughter whom he adored so much was living in a place several miles away fromhim. It was his custom to send his dog and cat to her daughter and bring her a present. Thedog was a bit old and had pretty much lost some teeth so he was no longer able to fight. But, healways knew how to find the way. The cat on the other hand was strong and shrewd so theycould help the other.(2) One day the rich man wanted to send a magic ring to his daughter. He called the dobgand cat. He said to the cat " You have shown a lot of character such as being shrewd andprudent so you may carry this magic ring to my daughter but you have to make sure to takegreat care of it." He also said to the dog You are to go with the cat to take this magic ring to mydaughter. Take care not to lose the way and be sure that no one bothers the cat'. Both animalspromised to do their best and went on their way.(3) On the way, they were impelled to cross a wide and deep river. They weredetermined to swim across as there was no bridge and they couldn't find a boat. The dog said tothe cat, "You need to hand me the ring;" "Oh no!", replied the cat. "Did you not remember whatthe master said just what each of us had to do?", "Yes, but you are not very good at swimmingso I can better take good care of it." The cat refused to disobey the master until the dogthreatened to kill the cat. He was left with no choice but to hand over the magic ring.(4) They began swimming but the current was so strong. It took them an hour in gettingover so they were both tired and weak. Just as they were about to come to the other side, thedog accidentally dropped the ring into the water and finding it seems impossible. The cat saidNow, we have to go back home and tell our master that we lost the ring". "Yes" answered thedog, "but I am scared". So they went back home. As they drew near the house the dog's fearOverpowered him that he ran away as fast as he could and was never seen again.(5) The master, surprised to see the cat back so soon, asked " Why are you alone?".The cat was a bit scared to answer at first. Where is the dog?" asked the master again, "Oh! Heran away' replied the cat. "Ran away?" said the master, "What do you mean? "Where is thering? Let me tell you what happened but please do not get angry"(5) When we reached the river bank, the doq asked me to hand him the ring, I refused alot of times but he threatened to kill me so I was left with no choice. The current was so strongand we were having a hard time crossing the river; so, on the way the dog dropped the ring andwe couldn't find it anymore"T told the dog to go back and tell you what happened, but he said he was so scaredthat he ran away as fast as he could".(8) With this, the master made a proclamation that whoever finds his old dog and canbring him back will be rewarded. The dog'can easily Be recognized às he was already old andhas no teeth. The master had also declared that the dog will be punished by cutting off his tail.(9) It was ordered that all the dogs shall take part in the search. Eversince, that time,when one dog meets another, he always says, "Are you the old dog who lost the ring?". If youwere that dog, your tail will be cut off. Then both the dogs show their teeth and wag their tailswhich means no. It was also that time when cats have been afraid of water.​</h2><br />

Your mind mapping ability may not enhance your brain functions.3. Left brain controls all the muscles on the right-hand side of the body andthe right brain controls the left side. One hemisphere may be slightly dominant, as with left- or right-handedness.4. Everybody is not expected for a better and smarter brain, the reason why there is no need to enhance brain functions.5. Always understand your dominant brain type, you may be able to adjust your study methods, and perhaps shape your schedule and coursework, to suit your own personality type.6. Remember that mind mapping is a highly effective way of losing information in and out of your brain. Mind mapping is not in any way acreative and logical means of note taking and note-making that literally "maps out" your ideas.7. New Mind Maps examples were popularized by author and consultant, Tony Buzan.8. Improving and following the steps in mind mapping will guide your mind map connected to each other.9. Need to apply more recommendations in mind mapping to make the mindmap easy. They are the use of colors, drawings, and symbols, keeping the topic label, as much as possible, short, and vary text size.10.

                            21. 1. The Philippines experiences an average of 20 typhoons a year. Being surrounded by bodies of water makes us prone to experience some weather disturbances. The biggest contributor of the weather disturbances in our country is the Pacific Ocean which lies on the eastern side of our country. The vast and warm waters of the ocean can generate many weather disturbances.
2. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high-pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low pressure system.
3. Weather disturbances are devastating. They can cause damage to our life and properties. Heavy winds can destroy power and communication lines. Roads and bridges are also damaged due to heavy rainfall and flooding. Weather disturbances can also destroy our means of livelihood. Heavy rain and strong winds can uproot trees and destroy crops that provide us with food. Therefore, there is always food shortage when there is a typhoon. (Source: Science Beyond Borders)
4. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts. Forest lands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for housing and furniture. As their natural habitat diminished, so did the population of the tamaraws, eagles and other animals.
5. Elephants are extremely intelligent animals. They have long memories. This memory serves the mother well during dry seasons when they need to guide their herds to even distant watering holes that they remember from the past. They also display signs of grief, joy, anger, and play.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Located along the typhoon belt in the Pacific, the Philippines is visited by an average of 20 typhoons every year, five of which are destructive. Being situated in the “Pacific Ring of Fire” makes it vulnerable to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Its geographical location and physical environment also contributes to its high-susceptibility to tsunami, sea level rise, storm surges, landslides, flood/flashflood/flooding, and drought.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            29. Read carefully the excerpt from the story “The Happy Mirror”. The do the activities that follow.
Many years ago, there was a small family in Japan. There lived a father, mother
and their little daughter. They took their daughter to the temple when she was only
thirty days old wearing a long kimono like all Japanese babies do. The parents gave
the baby a set of beautiful dolls on her first doll festival, and when their daughter turned
three, she was no longer a baby but a little girl fast growing up. She was loved by her
parents very much. One day, a messenger came and brought news that the father is
needed by the Emperor to Tokyo. They haven’t had a horse so the father will need to
walk the long way. The mother and the little daughter bid farewell to the father and
promised him that they will take care of each other and will wait for him. After many
days, the father came back and brought the mother and daughter presents. The little
girl received a doll and she was very glad while the mother was amazed by the present.
It was a thing which she saw a beautiful face of a woman. The husband laughed and
told her it was a mirror and she only saw her own reflection. He told her that if she
brings a smile to the mirror, she will see a smiling face and if she didn’t it will reflect
the mirror. The wife thanked her husband and promised that she will always bring a
smiling face to the mirror. She often looked at the mirror and does what she had
promised. She would always see a happy face in it. Many years passed and she grew
tired of looking at it. She decided to give the precious gift to her daughter who grew
into a woman exactly like her mother. One day, she called the daughter and gave a
beautiful box, and the daughter was surprised of what she saw. It was the image of
her mother inside the round shiny thing. It was the image of her mother she used to
look at when she was a little girl. The mother told her to smile every time she will look
at her inside the mirror and assured her that she will smile back. For that day on, the
daughter kept the box near her. Once each year, she opened it and proved that her
mother’s words was always true. Always she saw her mother’s smiling face when she
smiles at her. The daughter always remembers to bring smiles to the thing inside the
little box, and always the smiles come back at her.
