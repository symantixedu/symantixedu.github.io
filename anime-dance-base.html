                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Being physically active is one of the most important things people of all ages can do to maintain and improve their health. According to the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, moving more and sitting less has many positive benefits. Even better, the benefits of participating in any amount of activity begin immediately after and accumulate over time.</p><p></p><p>Evidence supporting the benefits of regular physical activity is well established, yet nearly 80% of American adults are not meeting guidelines for aerobic and muscle-strengthening activity. Gaining health benefits from physical activity depends on a personal effort to increase activity in ourselves, loved ones, and our communities. The newest addition of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans can be a helpful resource to increase physical activity. It discusses the proven benefits of regular physical activity and outlines the amounts and types recommended for all ages and populations.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>correct me if I'm wrong </p><br />
