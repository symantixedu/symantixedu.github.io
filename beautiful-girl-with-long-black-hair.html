                                            Origin of the Moon and Stars (A Philippine Myth)A long, long time ago, some Filipinos thought the moon was a silver crescent comb and the stars were necklaces of diamonds. The sky was said to be a mere arm-stretch away overhead. The Philippine myth goes this way.The myth says that once, a small community lived in the middle of a rice field. They focused on rice and corn agriculture and they brought in abundant harvest each year. One of the families in the community was Maria’s family. The myth continues that people in the community were so close that they knew each other well. Maria was know there as a pretty girl.Particularly, she was known for caring too much for her long, silky hair. The myth says it was her pride, and lots of other girls in the neighborhood envied her for it. And Maria loved it. She fancied herself the star of her village. So, the myth goes that she worked double time on her beauty, especially her long, jet black hair.Maria cared so much for her hair. The myth says, aside from daily comprehensive herbal rituals, she regularly brushed her hair with a special silver crescent-shape comb. The myth says she let nothing touch her hair except the best material around. Even as she went about her daily chore she wore a coiled string of jewels and diamonds (supposedly common as ordinary rocks that time) to crown her hair—that’s aside from the jeweled necklace she wore.One day, according to the myth, as she was pounding grains of corn and palay (rice stalks) in a native wooden pestle with a wooden mortar, her mother noticed the jeweled string around her head , the silver comb stuck in her hair, and the jeweled lace round her neck. She scolded her and told her to lay aside everything while working. So, continues the myth, Maria hanged the comb and jewelry on the sky above her. Wanting to finish her work in a hurry, she pounded the grains hard by raising the mortar really high. She didn’t notice hitting the sky which went up higher as she hit it with her pounding. Soon the sky went all the way up, along with her comb and jewelry. And they became the moon and the stars.1. Who is the main character in the story? _________________ 2.

It is believed she is old as the mountain itself. Very few people who have seen her wandering around the forest with brown skin, deep black eyes, and long hair Hunters have seen her standing on the edge of a cliff on moonlight nights with her long hair floating in the air and her singing echoing throughout the deep valleys. Maria Makiling is also known to have a good heart. She would appear as young girl to help old women gather firewood and slip nuggets, coins and jewels into their bundles of woods. She would also invite tires hunters to her home and served a warm meal and cold drinks. She often gives them a small parting gift of ginger, which hunters discover to have turned into gold when they got home. Source: https://slideplayer.com/maria-makiling!! 1.

                            5. Origin of the Moon and Stars (A Philippine Myth)A long, long time ago, some Filipinos thought the moon was a silver crescent comb and the stars were necklaces of diamonds. The sky was said to be a mere arm-stretch away overhead. The Philippine myth goes this way.The myth says that once, a small community lived in the middle of a rice field. They focused on rice and corn agriculture and they brought in abundant harvest each year. One of the families in the community was Maria’s family. The myth continues that people in the community were so close that they knew each other well. Maria was know there as a pretty girl.Particularly, she was known for caring too much for her long, silky hair. The myth says it was her pride, and lots of other girls in the neighborhood envied her for it. And Maria loved it. She fancied herself the star of her village. So, the myth goes that she worked double time on her beauty, especially her long, jet black hair.Maria cared so much for her hair. The myth says, aside from daily comprehensive herbal rituals, she regularly brushed her hair with a special silver crescent-shape comb. The myth says she let nothing touch her hair except the best material around. Even as she went about her daily chore she wore a coiled string of jewels and diamonds (supposedly common as ordinary rocks that time) to crown her hair—that’s aside from the jeweled necklace she wore.One day, according to the myth, as she was pounding grains of corn and palay (rice stalks) in a native wooden pestle with a wooden mortar, her mother noticed the jeweled string around her head , the silver comb stuck in her hair, and the jeweled lace round her neck. She scolded her and told her to lay aside everything while working. So, continues the myth, Maria hanged the comb and jewelry on the sky above her. Wanting to finish her work in a hurry, she pounded the grains hard by raising the mortar really high. She didn’t notice hitting the sky which went up higher as she hit it with her pounding. Soon the sky went all the way up, along with her comb and jewelry. And they became the moon and the stars.1. Who is the main character in the story? _________________ 2.

Once upon a time, there was a beautiful girl called Maria. She was tall, with black eyes, and long shining hair. The color of her skin was a clear light brow. One morning, while she was collecting firewood, she met a young man. He looked like a hunter. He was tall, handsome and very neatly dressed. No one knew who he was or where he came from Nor did anyone know his name. Maria liked him. He liked her too. Maria did not know this but he was an anito or a spirit from the sky. They became friends. Although they were good friends for a long time, the young man never asked Maria to became his wife. This made Maria very unhappy. "I have no parents or brothers or sisters," she said. "You too are alone. I am sure we could be happy together." "I didn't want to tell you this," the young man said, "but I am an anito. I cannot marry a human being. I have to return to the sky." + Maria was surprised. She did not know what to say. She held his hands tightly "please let me go," said the young man. I had hoped you would never find out wholam." There was a blinding flash of light and the young man disappeared. But as Maria was holding on to his hands so fightly, he left them behind. Of course, Maria was frightened. She ran home and buried them in her garden. Soon she saw a strange plant growing where she had buried them. The plant grew fast. Then some fruit appeared.
