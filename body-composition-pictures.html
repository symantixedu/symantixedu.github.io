                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Answer: 1. In the slideshow about bias, statements about a scene that three kids saw outside were made. The word bias here means being prejudice or making a judgement rarely based on a fact. In the slideshow, I analyzed each one of the statements and found the bias in them. Sally, Clifford, and Sylvia all saw the same things but interpreted them differently.</p><p></p><p>In the paper Sally's statement in the paper said, "While on a neighborhood walk, I saw a helpless little dog chained to a tree! The poor thing's tongue was hanging out!" Here it shows that Sally is including her sad, sentimental feelings into her statement. Sally uses the words "the poor thing" to describe the dog. Sally feels like the dog is being treated poorly, and she clearly has a thing for animals and loves animals as well. That</p><p></p><p>Clifford's statement was completely different from Sally's. The paper stated that Clifford said, “While on a neighborhood walk, I saw a ferocious pit bull tied to a tree by only a thin chain! The beast was showing its teeth and licking its chops!" In this statement it is also completely biased. Clifford's statement used the words "ferocious" and "beast" to describe the dog. Obviously, Clifford doesn't like pitbulls or dogs in general. In his statement, he used his personal feelings to describe what he saw which is what makes it biased.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Sylvia's statement is surprisingly not biased at all. Her statement in the paper said "While on a neighborhood walk, I saw a panting bull-dog on a leash under a shady tree." Sylvia is not like the other two kids because she does not include her opinions or feelings about the dog. She states exactly what she sees with no emotions involved. Her statement is the only one that is not biased, and has the facts. Which makes her statement the most reliable.</p><p></p><p>Briefly to conclude, all of this information shows how different people can see things. Everyone can be biased in their own ways. Being biased means making judgements barely based on facts. Here you can see where the kids are being biased, and where they are stating a fact.</p><br />
