                                            your Look around you. Many of the things that used to be manipulated only by hand can now be done using the computer. Look at the cover of book. Are there pictures on it? Those pictures were created using the computer. Colors were added using the computer. The entire design of the cover was completed using the computer. Search the Internet for digital art. Try to recall the different elements of art which you learned in 4th Grade. Are they found in digital art as well? Think about the different principles of art. Do they apply in digital art, 100? How is a digital artwork similar to an artwork done by hand? How is it different? In this lesson, you will revisit the different elements and principles of art and how they apply to digital art. You will also be introduced to the world of digital art and how and for what it is used today. In addition, you will be introduced to some of the common software used for digital art. An important part of this lesson is a presentation and discussion of the features and basic tools of a drawing software.​</a>
