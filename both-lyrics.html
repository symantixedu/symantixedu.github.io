They did so much, always putting the child before themselves, turning their eyes to his, becoming his foot whenever he stumbled, guiding the path taken. It was a song of the parent's sacrifice for the child that made it possible for the child to return the sacrifice he received. This song doesn’t go far from the song "because you love me" because the love shown in this song is love that can guide and sacrifice, love that does everything for the person you love. The child and the one who is being loved by someone are the ones who own this point of view, showing that “they are not in the position they are in without the people who love them". Tho' the song mapa shows that the child wants to repay the sacrifice intended for him by his parent while on the other hand says that " Am everything I am because you love me.", nevertheless, the love they received from their loved one is the most powerful one.</strong></p><br />
