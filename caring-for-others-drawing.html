                                            Making and Keeping FriendsMaking and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort. Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other’s happiness and supporting each other when times are tough. A lot of friends have things in common so it’s easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. Showing you care about the other person’s happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends’ faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don’t know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it’s uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it’s nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that’s when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care. pakisagutan plsss need kona po asap plss po​</a>

                                            Making and Keeping Friends Making and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort. Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other’s happiness and supporting each other when times are tough. A lot of friends have things in common so it’s easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. Showing you care about the other person’s happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends’ faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don’t know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it’s uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it’s nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that’s when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care. 1. Encircle the big Idea. 2. Draw a rectangle around each of the three MainTopics .

                            6. Making and Keeping FriendsMaking and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort. Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other’s happiness and supporting each other when times are tough. A lot of friends have things in common so it’s easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. Showing you care about the other person’s happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends’ faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don’t know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it’s uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it’s nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that’s when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care. pakisagutan plsss need kona po asap plss po​</h2><br />

                            17. Making and Keeping Friends Making and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort. Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other’s happiness and supporting each other when times are tough. A lot of friends have things in common so it’s easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. Showing you care about the other person’s happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends’ faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don’t know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it’s uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it’s nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that’s when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care. 1. Encircle the big Idea. 2. Draw a rectangle around each of the three MainTopics .
