                                            5. Ever since, every December of the year, my family is busy preparing different gifts like food. toys and school supplies. Before Christmas, we go to Bethany House. It is one of the orphanages here in Bulacan. My family works together in giving the gifts we prepared to all the children there. It is our way of giving back the blessings we received throughout the year. Whenever we see their smiles, without a word, we feel wonderful. This year 2021, I will be celebrating my 9th birthday. Instead of having a birthday party, I requested my mother to celebrate it with the children in the Bethany House. I received a big "yes" from her. I know this will be the best party I would ever have 2. Share your blessings. b. Help one another in achieving your goal. What happens in the story that leads you to believe this?​</a>

                                            Story #5. Ever since, every December of the year, my family is busy preparing different gifts like food, toys and school supplies. Before Christmas, we go to Bethany House. It is one of the orphanages here in Bulacan. My family works together in giving the gifts we prepared to all the children there. It is our way of giving back the blessings we received throughout the year. Whenever we see their smiles, without a word, we feel wonderful. This year 2021, I will be celebrating my 9th birthday. Instead of having a birthday party, I requested my mother to celebrate it with the children in the Bethany House. I received a big yes” from her. I know, this will be the best party I would ever have. What is the theme of the story? A. Share your blessings. B. Help one another in achieving your goal. What happens in the story that leads you to believe this?​</a>

                            17. Story #5. Ever since, every December of the year, my family is busy preparing different gifts like food, toys and school supplies. Before Christmas, we go to Bethany House. It is one of the orphanages here in Bulacan. My family works together in giving the gifts we prepared to all the children there. It is our way of giving back the blessings we received throughout the year. Whenever we see their smiles, without a word, we feel wonderful. This year 2021, I will be celebrating my 9th birthday. Instead of having a birthday party, I requested my mother to celebrate it with the children in the Bethany House. I received a big yes” from her. I know, this will be the best party I would ever have. What is the theme of the story? A. Share your blessings. B. Help one another in achieving your goal. What happens in the story that leads you to believe this?​</h2><br />
