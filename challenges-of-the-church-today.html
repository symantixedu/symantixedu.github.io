Despite that apparent intractability, however, some peace settlements have been crafted for contemporary intra-state armed conflicts where there have been religious incompatible claims and aspirations. This chapter explores the legal tools developed in such settlements and discusses their wider applicability as conflict resolution mechanisms. The analysis identifies seven specific conflict resolution mechanisms that have been utilised to address the religious dimensions of armed conflicts: constitutional secularism, religious freedom, religious power-sharing, religious autonomy, legalisation of religious political parties, inclusion of religious civil society actors and religious bonding. These seven mechanisms are analysed as part of two fundamentally different approaches to conflict resolution of religious dimensions: division vs integration; and reinforcement or decrease in the role of religion. The chapter demonstrates how religiously defined conflicts can also be transformed and brought to peaceful, negotiated endings.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What you can do best to assist in resolving the challenges of the Church in Asia in today's post-modern world is to be a good role model to those around you.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1.Female priests<p> </p><p></p><p>There is no conceivable reason why the church has resisted the ordination of female priests. Most other religions have already begun to accept women. It is shameful that women are not treated equally.</p>2.Celibacy<p></p><p>Frank Bruni, op-ed writer for the New York Times, wrote a story about celibacy recently, suggesting that it may be too much to ask a man to abstain his entire life, and so the rules requiring celibacy among priests should be reconsidered. By mandating celibacy, the church may be, in effect, encouraging aberrant behavior such as pedophilia and physical contact of priests with men and women.</p>3.Birth control<p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>Catholics are not permitted to use birth control under any circumstances. This is one of the most backward and harmful restrictions in religious canon. Why wouldn’t the church allow safe and effective methods to control the size of families (and population)? Even worse, why would the church object to birth control in the prevention of disease including AIDS and STDs.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The church has more than its share of critics these days.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes the criticism is unwarranted. People project their issues onto a congregation or onto the church, which is never healthy.</p><p></p><p>And, of course, the church will inevitably run into criticism.</p><p></p><p>What we’re doing is counter-cultural and will never be met with universal applause. The Gospel, even when powerfully shared, got John the Baptist, the Apostle Paul, Jesus and the prophets killed, just to name a few. While it seems strange to say it, even love, when seen fully and magnificently, gets rejected.</p><p></p><p>But other times we absolutely deserve the criticism that comes our way.</p><br />

                            21. why does the evolution of technology become a challenge in the church today?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The evolution of technology presents several challenges for the church today. Here are a few reasons why:</p><p></p><p>Change in communication: Technology has changed the way people communicate with each other. It has made communication faster, more accessible, and more convenient. This has led to a shift in the way people interact with each other, which can be challenging for the church to adapt to. For example, people may prefer to attend online church services instead of in-person services, and this can be a challenge for churches that are not equipped to offer this option.</p><p></p><p>Online distractions: With the rise of technology, people are now more distracted than ever. Social media and other online platforms can be a distraction from attending church, and it can be challenging for churches to keep people engaged.</p><p></p><p>Theological challenges: As technology evolves, it raises new ethical and theological questions that the church needs to address. For example, the use of artificial intelligence raises questions about the nature of humanity and our relationship with technology. The church needs to address these questions to stay relevant and provide guidance to its followers.</p><p></p><p>Cultural shifts: Technology has brought about significant cultural shifts that the church needs to navigate. For example, the rise of individualism and consumerism can be at odds with traditional Christian values. Churches need to find ways to communicate their message in a way that resonates with modern culture.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the evolution of technology presents several challenges for the church, but it also presents opportunities. Churches can use technology to reach a wider audience and engage with people in new ways. To do this, they need to be willing to adapt and embrace new technologies while staying true to their core values and message.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p> { Solidarity }<p></p>We are one  human family whatever our national, racial, ethnic, economic, and ideological  differences. We are our brothers’ and sisters’ keepers, wherever they may be.  Loving our neighbor has global dimensions in a shrinking world. At the core of  the virtue of solidarity is the pursuit of justice and peace. Pope Paul VI  taught that “if you want peace, work for justice.”1 The Gospel calls us to be  peacemakers. Our love for all our sisters and brothers demands that we promote  peace in a world surrounded by violence and conflict.<p></p><br />

Scripture teaches us that “all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose” (Romans 8:28). Yet when we encounter difficulties, we often wonder, Why? Searching for answers and learning to view “bad things” as “good things in disguise” are disciplines that God wants His children to develop as they mature spiritually. (See I Corinthians 2:14 and Romans 8:1–17.)</p><p>AND PRAY ALWAYS</p><br />
