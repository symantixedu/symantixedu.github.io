1.Ducks, like other animals, are useful to human beings. They provide us with eggs and meat to eat. Some ducks provide us with feathers that are used for stuffing quilts and pillows. The feathers are usually from the Elder duck. To line their nests, the females pluck feathers from their beast. Their feathers are harvested in Iceland where they are found everywhere along the coast and are a valuable source of income for the people there. Elders feed on mussels, sea snails, crabs, shrimps and barnacles. They also catch fish, dig for snails, and eat other small crustaceans and some seaweeds. *
2.The turkey is the largest bird on the farm. The male turkey is called tom. The female is called a hen, and the baby is called a poult. A young male is called a jake, while a young is called a jenny. The male turkey has a long wattle and base of the bill, and additional wattles on the neck. Turkeys are omnivores. They feed on insects, plants, corn, wheat, and seeds. *
3.The life span of a chicken is about 10-15 years. The male is larger and more brightly colored than the female. This is a common feature in birds. The males show off their colorful feathers to attract the females. A chicken has a comb on the head and two wattles under the neck. The male has a larger comb compared to the female. The male is called a rooster, the female is called a hen, and the young is called a chick. The female is usually ready to lay her first eggs when she is around six months. Chickens are really amazing animals. *
4.Eagles feed on small mammals, birds or fish using their sharp talons, and huge hooked beaks to grab and tear their prey. Some eagles search out their prey. Some eagles search out their prey from the waterside. Then, they glide down and hook a wriggling fish in their talons. Eagles are large, powerful hunting birds that are found most parts of the world. *
5.The ash from Mt. Pinatubo went as far as Cambodia. The gas went up at least 20 kilometers into the stratosphere where it condensed into sulfuric acid aerosol. As long as it was there, it lowered the world’s temperature. The ash and gas spewed by Mt. Pinatubo affected the atmosphere of the whole world. *</a>
