                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Why are some places on Earth cold while other places are warm?</strong></p><p>The tropics consistently get more sun than either of the poles. They have a consistent amount of light and warmth around the equator, while the poles receive little light in winter, and long days in summer, giving them distinct warm and cold seasons.</p><p><strong>2. What are the factors that affect the seasons in the Philippines?</strong></p><p><strong>Pressure zones. </strong>There are two major factors affecting the seasonal change globally: the High Pressure Area (HPA), which  originates from colder regions, and the Low Pressure Area (LPA), which propagates mainly in warmer regions.  Those gigantic pressure zones in the Philippines  are crucial to determining our tropical climate.  We have just recently witnessed the development of several tropical Pacific  LPAs, and the advance of the Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ). This pushes local thunderstorm build-up, bringing  rain showers and occasional flooding in areas.</p><p><strong>Monsoon.</strong> The monsoon is a seasonal cycle of rain and  wind that occurs, among other areas, across South Asia.  The wind system carries heat from more tropical areas, driving the distribution of rainfall over  soil, which in turn controls temperature and returns the greenery to large tracts of land.</p><p><strong>Tropical cyclone.</strong> The annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation drives moonsoon rains stronger  along the western shores of the Philippines, based on recent studies.  With the advance of the Southwest Monsoon (Habagat) during mid-June through late August, the prevalence of tropical cyclones we call "bagyo" will certainly guarantee a steady stream of  warm and most air masses — thus the incessant build-up of rain-bearing clouds toward the West Philippine Sea, and the all-too-familiar heavy flooding we have come to dread.</p><p><strong>3. How would you compare the two seasons in the Philippines?</strong></p><p>The two seasons in the Philippines are the rainy/wet season and the dry season. The rainy season happens from May to October, and the dry season can be subdivided based on temperature - cold dry from November to February and hot dry from March to April.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#carryonlearning</p><p>#betterwithbrainly</p><br />

Why doesn't air mass always remain inone place?5. How does global warming affect theweather changes in thePhilippines?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Changes in weather are primarily caused by changes in the atmosphere's temperature, air pressure, and humidity</p><p>2.The effects of barometric pressure on water chemistry and meteorological conditions are significant. When contrasted to lower air pressure, higher pressure allows more gas, such as oxygen, to dissolve in water. At sea level, for example, more oxygen is dissolved in water than at high altitudes.</p><p>3.Fronts of cold weather normally migrate from the northwest to the southeast. The air behind a cold front is colder and drier than that which before it. Temperatures can drop more than 15 degrees in an hour when a cold front moves through. When a warm front sweeps through, the air gets considerably warmer and more humid.</p><p>4.An air mass has roughly the same temperature and humidity. Air masses form over regions where the air is stable for a long enough time. The air takes on the characteristics of the region. Air masses move when they are pushed by high level winds.</p><p>5.The Philippines is extremely sensitive to the effects of climate change, which include sea level rise, an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events, rising temperatures, and excessive rainfall.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Day and night are due to the Earth rotating on its axis, not its orbiting around the sun.</p><p></p><p>2.Seasons are not very pronounced, relatively dry from November to April, and wet during the rest of the year. </p><p></p><p>3.The seasons are caused by the tilt of Earth's axis in relation to the sun.</p><p></p><p>4.South Korea,Because my seven anpanman's their and also they has a lot of tourists spot,nice view and nice people.Also they has a lot of yummy and delicious different kind of foods.</p><p></p><p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>1. We have day and night because the Earth rotates. It spins on its axis, which is an imaginary line passing through the North and South Poles.</p><p></p><p>2.The Philippines has five types of climates and two types of season which is the wet and the dry season. The season in the country is based on the amount of rainfall that is also dependent on location in the country. It is very impossible for the Philippines to have the four seasons, namely spring, winter, summer and fall. But if the climate is changing because of the greenhouse effect then maybe it is possible. But with the location of the Philippines which is at the equator then it would be impossible.</p><p></p><p>3. The seasons are caused by the tilt of Earth's axis in relation to the sun. The direction of the tilt never changes. But as the Earth orbits the sun, different parts of the planet are exposed to direct sunlight. During summer, Antarctica is on the side of Earth tilted toward the sun and is in constant sunlight.</p><br />

                            17. Answer the following questions below to describe the elements ofweather changes and its factors affecting weather patterns in thePhilippines1. Why does the weather change?2. What is the importance of knowing the air pressure?3. How does the weather in a cold front and the weather at a warmfront differ?4. Why doesn't air mass always remain in one place?5. How does global warming affect the weather changes in thePhilippines?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Changes in weather are primarily result of a change in temperature, air pressure, and humidity in the atmosphere. ... For example, a sudden drop or rise in temperature can cause a significant contrast in the air pressure of neighboring air masses, which can result in strong and gusty winds.</p><p>2.Atmospheric pressure is an indicator of weather. When a low-pressure system moves into an area, it usually leads to cloudiness, wind, and precipitation. High-pressure systems usually lead to fair, calm weather. A barometer measures atmospheric pressure, which is also called barometric pressure</p><p>3.Cold weather fronts usually move from northwest to southeast. The air behind a cold front is colder and drier than the air in front. When a cold front passes through, temperatures can drop more than 15 degrees within an hour. ... When a warm front passes, the air becomes noticeably warmer and more humid than it was before.</p><p>4.Answer: An air mass, then, is named by the combination of its humidity and temperature designation. ... The very cold high latitude air does not hold much moisture and does not have heavy evaporation or precipitation, so mA air is also not found.</p><p>5.The Philippines is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including sea level rise, increased frequency of extreme weather events, rising temperatures and extreme rainfall.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Many elements influence a region's climate, including the quantity of sunshine it receives, its elevation above sea level, the form of the land, and its proximity to oceans. Climate fluctuates depending on distance from the equator since the equator receives more sunshine than the poles.</p><p></p><p>2. Because of its proximity to the equator, the Philippines is classified as a tropical country with just wet and dry seasons, as opposed to the four seasons experienced by other countries. The country has two seasons, the rainy season and the dry season, which are determined by the amount of rainfall.</p><p></p><p>3. Based on the average of all weather stations in the Philippines, excluding Baguio, the mean annual temperature is 26.6o C. The coolest months fall in January with a mean temperature of 25.5oC while the warmest month occurs in May with a mean temperature of 28.3oC. Latitude is an insignificant factor in the variation of temperature while altitude shows greater contrast in temperature. Thus, the mean annual temperature of Baguio with an elevation of 1,500 meters is 18.3oC. This makes the temperature of Baguio comparable with those in the temperate climate and because of this, it is known as the summer capital of the Philippines.</p><p>The mean annual temperature in the Philippines, excluding Baguio, is 26.6o C, based on the average of all meteorological stations. The coldest month is January, with a mean temperature of 25.5 degrees Celsius, and the warmest month is May, with a mean temperature of 28.3 degrees Celsius. Temperature variation is unaffected by latitude, however temperature contrast is increased by height. As a result, the average yearly temperature in Baguio, which is 1,500 meters above sea level, is 18.3 degrees Celsius. As a result, the temperature in Baguio is comparable to that in temperate climates, earning it the title of Philippine summer capital.</p><p></p><p>4. Different levels of radiation received from the Sun at different places of the Earth at different times of the year generate climate variances around the world. The equator receives more heat from the Sun than the north and south poles, where the angle of the Sun's beams is lower.</p><p></p><p>5. Climate change has varied consequences in different parts of the world. Some areas will warm significantly more than others, some will receive more rainfall, while others will be subjected to more frequent droughts. People and ecosystems are being impacted by regional temperature and precipitation variations.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>#CarryOnLearning#Brainly.ph<p></p>Hope it helps&lt;8 wc<br />
