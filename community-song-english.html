The major elements of culture are symbols, language, norms, values,and artifacts.a. A symbol is anything that is used to stand for something else. People who share a culture often attach a specific meaning to an object, gesture, sound, or image. For example, a cross is a significant symbol to Christians. It is not simply two pieces of wood attached to each other, nor is it just an old object of torture and execution. To Christians, it represents the basis of their entire religion, and they have great reverence for the symbol.b. Language is a system of words and symbols used to communicate with other people. This includes full languages as we usually think of them, such as English, Spanish, French, etc. but, it also includes body language, slang, and common phrases that are unique to certain groups of people.C. Systems of values are culturally defined standards for what is good or desirable. Members of the culture use the shared system of values to decide what is good and what is bad."​</a>

</p><p>O mga bituing gabay ng kalangitan,

</p><p>1ST CHORUS:
</p><p>Si bunso rin ba’y nasasabik,
</p><p>Na ako’y muling makabalik?
</p><p>Sa lungkot ba’y napapahibik
</p><p>At hanap ang yakap ko’t halik?
</p><p>
</p><p>VERSE 3:
</p><p>Pagbalik nyo doon sa likod nitong mundo,
</p><p>Ihatid nyo naman itong pagmamahal ko;
</p><p>Diwa ng pag-ibig ay laging ikandado
</p><p>Sa tahanang sanhi nitong pagsisikap ko!
</p><p>
</p><p>LAST CHORUS:
</p><p>Pero kung di inaasahang
</p><p>Pag-uwi ko’y di na makamtan,
</p><p>O butuin, huwag nyong kalimutang
</p><p>Sila ay laging mabantayan!

Your song!Direction: Read the statements below and compose a song which the lyrics are literally, discussing what you understand."The actualization of human being in all his/her learning is what we called culture. This idea is the overall concept about the new topic. As the lesson presented, it will give you the meaning of culture like the following:1. Culture refers to a group or community which shares common experiences that shape the way its members understand the world. It includes groups that we are born into, such as race, national origin,16gender, class, or religion. It can also include a group we join orbecome part of.2. Culture is a strong part of people's lives. It influences their views, values, humor, hopes, loyalties, worries and fears. It helps to have some perspective and understanding of their cultures.3. Culture and society defined, culture consists of the beliefs, behaviors,objects, and other characteristics common to the members of aparticular group or society.4. Through culture, people and groups define themselves, conform tosociety's shared values, and contribute to society.5. The major elements of culture are symbols, language, norms, values,and artifacts.a. A symbol is anything that is used to stand for something else. People who share a culture often attach a specific meaning to an object, gesture, sound, or image. For example, a cross is a significant symbol to Christians. It is not simply two pieces of wood attached to each other, nor is it just an old object of torture and execution. To Christians, it represents the basis of their entire religion, and they have great reverence for the symbol.b. Language is a system of words and symbols used to communicate with other people. This includes full languages as we usually think of them, such as English, Spanish, French, etc. but, it also includes body language, slang, and common phrases that are unique to certain groups of people.C. Systems of values are culturally defined standards for what is good or desirable. Members of the culture use the shared system of values to decide what is good and what is bad."​</h2><br />
