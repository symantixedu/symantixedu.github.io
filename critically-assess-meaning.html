We propose three practical ways in which such a community approach within the assessment environment may be prompted and enhanced through the use of: social learning space, both physical and virtual; social learning, technical learning and collaborative assessment practices within developing student to enhance intelligence. Exploring the national student survey in TVL: Assessment and feedback issues The Higher Education Academy, Centre for Research into Quality of assessment, (2008) It asks all fulltime and part-time undergraduate students registered at participating institutions about their learning experiences during their final year of study by using to those technically sources it makes easier and faster. It has highlighted that students are notably less positive about assessment and feedback on their assignments than about other aspects of their learning experience. In addition, Saxon, Levine-Brown and Boylan (2008) accurate assessment, effective academic advising, and appropriate placement are critical components of successful developmental education programs (Boylan, 2002; McCabe, 2000; Morante, 1989). Assessment is necessary in order to determine what student skills need to be developed. Advising is necessary to ensure that students know what assessment results mean and why they need to be placed in specific courses. Unfortunately, practically all assessment done in universities is cognitive. Comprehension assessment measures how much students may know about a particular subject at the time of testing. The results are usually reported as raw scores or percentiles indicating where students' skills fall along a continuum of all those on whom the comprehension assessment instrument has been norm. Although the information from such instruments is generally valid, reliable, and effective for placement, it does not address all of the factors that might contribute to student success. For instance, few efforts are made to assess students' affective characteristics such as motivation, attitudes toward learning, autonomy, or anxiety. According to a recent study by Gerlaugh, Thompson, Boylan, and Davis (2007), although almost all community colleges assess students' enlightenment skills, only 7% of them assess students' affective characteristics.​​</a>

Marxist criticism considers literary works as reflections of the social institutions from which they originate 20. Formalist criticism is concerned with the ways in which the subject reinforces or undermines the economic political, social, and psychological oppression of women. 21. The Marxist examines the form or structure of the subject to be criticized as a whole. 22. Reader-response describes what happens in the reader's mind while interpreting a text and reflects that reading, like writing, is a creative process. 23. The concern in moral criticism is not only to discover meaning but also to determine whether works of literature are both true and significant. 24. Historical criticism explores the historical, social, political and cultural contexts surrounding the creation and reception of a work of literature; it uses history as a means of understanding a literary work more clearly. 25. There is no right or wrong answer to a reading response critique. Nonetheless, it is important that you demonstrate an understanding of the reading and clearly explain and support your reactions.​</a>

Exploring the national student survey in TVL: Assessment and feedback issues The Higher Education Academy, Centre for Research into Quality of assessment, (2008) It asks all fulltime and part-time undergraduate students registered at participating institutions about their learning experiences during their final year of study by using to those technically sources it makes easier and faster. It has highlighted that students are notably less positive about assessment and feedback on their assignments than about other aspects of their learning experience. In addition, Saxon, Levine-Brown and Boylan (2008) accurate assessment, effective academic advising, and appropriate placement are critical components of successful developmental education programs (Boylan, 2002; McCabe, 2000; Morante, 1989). Assessment is necessary in order to determine what student skills need to be developed. Advising is necessary to ensure that students know what assessment results mean and why they need to be placed in specific courses. Unfortunately, practically all assessment done in universities is cognitive. Comprehension assessment measures how much students may know about a particular subject at the time of testing. The results are usually reported as raw scores or percentiles indicating where students' skills fall along a continuum of all those on whom the comprehension assessment instrument has been norm. Although the information from such instruments is generally valid, reliable, and effective for placement, it does not address all of the factors that might contribute to student success. For instance, few efforts are made to assess students' affective characteristics such as motivation, attitudes toward learning, autonomy, or anxiety. According to a recent study by Gerlaugh, Thompson, Boylan, and Davis (2007), although almost all community colleges assess students' enlightenment skills, only 7% of them assess students' affective characteristics.​​​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The passage discusses the importance of a community approach to assessment in education, specifically in technical and vocational learning (TVL). The approach involves creating a social learning space and using collaborative assessment practices to enhance student learning and intelligence. The national student survey in TVL shows that students are less positive about assessment and feedback than other aspects of their learning experience. The passage also highlights the critical components of successful developmental education programs, such as accurate assessment, effective academic advising, and appropriate placement. However, most assessment in universities is cognitive, and few efforts are made to assess students' affective characteristics, such as motivation and attitudes towards learning. Overall, the passage emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to assessment in education.</p><br />

The Marxist examines the form or structure of the subject to be criticized as a whole. 22. Reader-response describes what happens in the reader's mind while interpreting a text and reflects that reading, like writing, is a creative process. 23. The concern in moral criticism is not only to discover meaning but also to determine whether works of literature are both true and significant. 24. Historical criticism explores the historical, social, political and cultural contexts surrounding the creation and reception of a work of literature; it uses history as a means of understanding a literary work more clearly. 25.

We propose three practical ways in which such a community approach within the assessment environment may be prompted and enhanced through the use of: social learning space, both physical and virtual; social learning, technical learning and collaborative assessment practices within developing student to enhance intelligence. Exploring the national student survey in TVL: Assessment and feedback issues The Higher Education Academy, Centre for Research into Quality of assessment, (2008) It asks all fulltime and part-time undergraduate students registered at participating institutions about their learning experiences during their final year of study by using to those technically sources it makes easier and faster. It has highlighted that students are notably less positive about assessment and feedback on their assignments than about other aspects of their learning experience. In addition, Saxon, Levine-Brown and Boylan (2008) accurate assessment, effective academic advising, and appropriate placement are critical components of successful developmental education programs (Boylan, 2002; McCabe, 2000; Morante, 1989). Assessment is necessary in order to determine what student skills need to be developed. Advising is necessary to ensure that students know what assessment results mean and why they need to be placed in specific courses. Unfortunately, practically all assessment done in universities is cognitive. Comprehension assessment measures how much students may know about a particular subject at the time of testing. The results are usually reported as raw scores or percentiles indicating where students' skills fall along a continuum of all those on whom the comprehension assessment instrument has been norm. Although the information from such instruments is generally valid, reliable, and effective for placement, it does not address all of the factors that might contribute to student success. For instance, few efforts are made to assess students' affective characteristics such as motivation, attitudes toward learning, autonomy, or anxiety. According to a recent study by Gerlaugh, Thompson, Boylan, and Davis (2007), although almost all community colleges assess students' enlightenment skills, only 7% of them assess students' affective characteristics.​​​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The passage discusses the need for a community approach to assessment in technical and vocational learning (TVL), which involves creating a social learning space and using collaborative assessment practices to enhance student learning and intelligence. The national student survey in TVL highlights that students are less positive about assessment and feedback on their assignments than other aspects of their learning experience. The passage also emphasizes the critical components of successful developmental education programs, such as accurate assessment, effective academic advising, and appropriate placement, and notes that most assessment in universities is cognitive and does not address affective characteristics that may contribute to student success. The passage underscores the need for a holistic approach to assessment that considers all factors that impact student learning and success.</p><br />

                            30. pa summary pounderstanding; and finally, a ‘community of practice' approach that centers on how students and teachers are absorbed into and become part of the academic practices for technical community. We propose three practical ways in which such a community approach within the assessment environment may be prompted and enhanced through the use of: social learning space, both physical and virtual; social learning, technical learning and collaborative assessment practices within developing student to enhance intelligence. Exploring the national student survey in TVL: Assessment and feedback issues The Higher Education Academy, Centre for Research into Quality of assessment, (2008) It asks all fulltime and part-time undergraduate students registered at participating institutions about their learning experiences during their final year of study by using to those technically sources it makes easier and faster. It has highlighted that students are notably less positive about assessment and feedback on their assignments than about other aspects of their learning experience. In addition, Saxon, Levine-Brown and Boylan (2008) accurate assessment, effective academic advising, and appropriate placement are critical components of successful developmental education programs (Boylan, 2002; McCabe, 2000; Morante, 1989). Assessment is necessary in order to determine what student skills need to be developed. Advising is necessary to ensure that students know what assessment results mean and why they need to be placed in specific courses. Unfortunately, practically all assessment done in universities is cognitive. Comprehension assessment measures how much students may know about a particular subject at the time of testing. The results are usually reported as raw scores or percentiles indicating where students' skills fall along a continuum of all those on whom the comprehension assessment instrument has been norm. Although the information from such instruments is generally valid, reliable, and effective for placement, it does not address all of the factors that might contribute to student success. For instance, few efforts are made to assess students' affective characteristics such as motivation, attitudes toward learning, autonomy, or anxiety. According to a recent study by Gerlaugh, Thompson, Boylan, and Davis (2007), although almost all community colleges assess students' enlightenment skills, only 7% of them assess students' affective characteristics.​​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This passage discusses the importance of assessment and feedback in education, specifically in technical and vocational learning environments. The authors propose a "community of practice" approach to assessment, which focuses on involving students and teachers in academic practices and enhancing collaborative assessment practices. The passage also highlights the results of the National Student Survey, which shows that students are less positive about assessment and feedback on their assignments compared to other aspects of their learning experience. The passage also emphasizes the importance of accurately assessing student skills and affective characteristics such as motivation, attitudes, and anxiety, and suggests that universities should focus more on assessing these factors in addition to cognitive skills.</p><br />
