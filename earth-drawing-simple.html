                                            Exercise A Directions: Identify the developmental pattern of the given paragraphs. Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. 1. In recent decades, cities have grown so large that now about 50% of the Earth's population lives in urban areas. There are several reasons for this. First, the increasing industrialization of the nineteenth century resulted in the creation of many factory jobs, which tended to be located in cities. These jobs, with their promise for a better material life, attracted many people from rural areas. Second, there were many schools established to educate the children of the new factory laborers. The promise of a better education persuaded many families to leave farming communities and move to the cities. Finally, as the cities grew, people established places of leisure, entertainment, and culture, such as stadiums, theaters, and museums. For many people, these facilities made city life appear more interesting than life on farm, and therefore, drew them away from rural areas. 2. The internet has evolved from simple dial-up technology to high speed data networks. It has undergone continuous evolution whish was caused by the need of the people to transmit high traffic and high-bandwidth applications over the network. The continuous advancement of software technology on the internet are the Local Area Network (LAN). This connects computers in one location. There is also the Wide Area Network (WAN) which interconnect different LANs. The Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) Wimax allows wireless, internet accessing using internet Protocol (IP). The General Packet Radio Service Networks (GPRS) allows mobile users to access the internet using cellular phones. Then, there is the Voice Over Internet Protoco; (VOIP) which allows telephone calls on the internet using Internet Protocol (IP). The Multimedia Streaming allows Audio/Video streaming over the internet. Then there is GigaPops (Gigabits-per-second Point of Presence) which allows very high speed transmission. Finally, there is the cluster of the Grid Computing which allows intensive computations to be distributed to thousands of computers and let them process computation simultaneously. 3.

                                            Gettysburg AddressBy Abraham Lincoln1Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.2Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. 3We are met on a great battle-field of that war. 4We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that nation might live. 5It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.6But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate -- we cannot consecrate -- we cannot hallow -- this ground. 7The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. 8The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. 9It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. 10It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth./************/1. To what composition does Abraham Lincoln refer in the beginning sentence of his famous speech, Gettysburg Address?A. Constitution of the Confederate States of AmericaB.

Anaphora is a rhetorical term when a writer or speaker repeats the same beginning of a sentence several times. In which of the following lines did Lincoln include an anaphora?A. sentence 1 C. sentence 3B. sentence 6 D. sentence 84. Which of the following statements shows an example of parallelism?A. statement 2 C. statement 3B. statement 5 D. statement 85. What American value is represented in the speech?A.

                            9. Exercise A Directions: Identify the developmental pattern of the given paragraphs. Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. 1. In recent decades, cities have grown so large that now about 50% of the Earth's population lives in urban areas. There are several reasons for this. First, the increasing industrialization of the nineteenth century resulted in the creation of many factory jobs, which tended to be located in cities. These jobs, with their promise for a better material life, attracted many people from rural areas. Second, there were many schools established to educate the children of the new factory laborers. The promise of a better education persuaded many families to leave farming communities and move to the cities. Finally, as the cities grew, people established places of leisure, entertainment, and culture, such as stadiums, theaters, and museums. For many people, these facilities made city life appear more interesting than life on farm, and therefore, drew them away from rural areas. 2. The internet has evolved from simple dial-up technology to high speed data networks. It has undergone continuous evolution whish was caused by the need of the people to transmit high traffic and high-bandwidth applications over the network. The continuous advancement of software technology on the internet are the Local Area Network (LAN). This connects computers in one location. There is also the Wide Area Network (WAN) which interconnect different LANs. The Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) Wimax allows wireless, internet accessing using internet Protocol (IP). The General Packet Radio Service Networks (GPRS) allows mobile users to access the internet using cellular phones. Then, there is the Voice Over Internet Protoco; (VOIP) which allows telephone calls on the internet using Internet Protocol (IP). The Multimedia Streaming allows Audio/Video streaming over the internet. Then there is GigaPops (Gigabits-per-second Point of Presence) which allows very high speed transmission. Finally, there is the cluster of the Grid Computing which allows intensive computations to be distributed to thousands of computers and let them process computation simultaneously. 3.

                            19. Gettysburg AddressBy Abraham Lincoln1Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.2Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. 3We are met on a great battle-field of that war. 4We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that nation might live. 5It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.6But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate -- we cannot consecrate -- we cannot hallow -- this ground. 7The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. 8The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. 9It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. 10It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth./************/1. To what composition does Abraham Lincoln refer in the beginning sentence of his famous speech, Gettysburg Address?A. Constitution of the Confederate States of AmericaB. The Articles of ConfederationC. The Declaration of IndependenceD. The United States Constitution (E) Emancipation Proclamation2.

Anaphora is a rhetorical term when a writer or speaker repeats the same beginning of a sentence several times. In which of the following lines did Lincoln include an anaphora?A. sentence 1 C. sentence 3B. sentence 6 D. sentence 84. Which of the following statements shows an example of parallelism?A. statement 2 C. statement 3B. statement 5 D. statement 85. What American value is represented in the speech?A. All are created equally regardless of birth color, religious belief, sexual orientation or wealth.B. It is about the value of optimism and of facing tough times with the same tenacity with which you face good times.C. It speaks on the value of simple, hard work and how one does not need to imbue it with a special meaning for it to have value.D. The speech embodies perseverance and deepened or extended contributions to American life and culture until those contributions are impossible to ignore.
