                        <p>The function of an electric can opener is to open can easily. Electric Can Opener is more convenient to use than a manual can opener, but the process is very much the same. The difference is that electric can opener has a physical motion of turning the wheel that spins the can automatically, using the electricity. In using Manual Can Opener, you need to use your strength and arms to open the can. manual can opener function by placing the metal tooth on the lip of the can, to align the wheel to the rim of the can. You need to grip the two handle using one arm for a secure fit and the other arm to start turning handle to rotate the wheel. That is the difference between electric and manual can opener. In using an electric can opener, do not use a can that has an easy-open lid. You have to be sure that the cutting blade is inside the rim of the can. The cutting blade will cut around the outer edge of the lid to open the can. Ask assistance on how to use electric can opener from adults or an adept person to avoid accidents.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Related Links to Electric Can Opener:</p>https://brainly.ph/question/2099717https://brainly.ph/question/2372954https://brainly.ph/question/1323874<p>An <strong>electric can opener</strong> functions as the same as a manual can opener but differs in on how it operates. It uses electricity or power from the outlet to perform its functions unlike the ordinary can opener, that is manually operated by hand. It is use to open steel can easily without harming the user's hand. It uses a gear that slides across the circumference of the steel can. In the market, it is more expensive than the ordinary or the manual can opener. In some food businesses, they prefer to use this type of can opener for faster process of opening cans though it may consume more power because it needed electricity to perform its functions.  </p><p>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A can opener is a device used to open steel cans. Simple can openers, like those found in pocket knives, are operated by walking the device around the edge of the can while digging into the lid. The lid will have very jagged edges after removal.This begins to rotate the wheel underneath that then cuts into the can. Work your way around the rim of the can as you turn the handle. This action pierces the seal, cutting into the can as it moves around the edge of the lid.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

  you	
  ever	
  thought	
  about	
  how	
  much	
  we	
  depend	
  on	
  electricity?	
  Electricity	
  is	
  a	
  form	
  of	
  energythat	
  runs	
  computers,	
  appliances,	
  and	
  radios.	
  Electricity	
  lights	
  our	
  homes,	
  schools,	
  and	
  office	
  buildings.	
  Without	
  it,	
  our	
  world	
  would	
  be	
  a	
  much	
  different	
  place.	
  In	
  fact,	
  before	
  electricity	
  was	
  discovered,	
  people	
  mainly	
  used	
  fire	
  to	
  cook	
  and	
  to	
  provide	
  light	
  and	
  heat.	
  Electricity	
  has	
  become	
  an	
  important	
  part	
  of	
  our	
  lives.	
  You	
  might	
  know	
  that	
  the	
  use	
  of	
  electricity	
  often	
  involves	
  wires.	
  But	
  how	
  do	
  you	
  think	
  electricity	
  travels	
  through	
  these	
  wires?	
  How	
  does	
  it	
  produce	
  otherkinds	
  of	
  energy	
  like	
  light,	
  heat,	
  and	
  sound?How	
  does	
  electricity	
  travel?All	
  matter	
  is	
  made	
  up	
  of	
  particles.	
  Electrical	
  energyis	
  energy	
  produced	
  by	
  the	
  movement	
  of	
  certain	
  particles.	
  This	
  flow	
  of	
  particles	
  is	
  called	
  electric	
  current.So	
  what	
  does	
  this	
  have	
  to	
  do	
  with	
  lights,	
  appliances,	
  and	
  computers?	
  In	
  order	
  to	
  light	
  a	
  light	
  bulb	
  or	
  turn	
  on	
  a	
  computer,	
  we	
  need	
  to	
  produce	
  a	
  continuous	
  electric	
  current.	
  To	
  do	
  this,	
  we	
  need	
  an	
  energy	
  source.	
  Common	
  energy	
  sources	
  include	
  batteriesand	
  generators.	
  You’ll	
  learn	
  more	
  about	
  these	
  shortly.	
  An	
  electric	
  current	
  also	
  needs	
  a	
  path	
  along	
  which	
  it	
  can	
  travel.	
  An	
  electric	
  circuitis	
  a	
  pathway	
  through	
  which	
  electric	
  current	
  flows.	
  Now	
  you	
  know	
  that	
  electric	
  current	
  flows	
  through	
  a	
  path	
  called	
  a	
  circuit.	
  You	
  also	
  know	
  that	
  a	
  continuous	
  electric	
  current	
  needs	
  an	
  energy	
  source	
  such	
  as	
  a	
  battery.	
  What	
  else	
  is	
  needed	
  to	
  make	
  a	
  circuit?What	
  is	
  necessary	
  to	
  have	
  energy	
  flow	
  through	
  a	
  circuit?	
  You	
  can	
  think	
  of	
  a	
  circuit	
  as	
  a	
  loop.	
  In	
  order	
  for	
  electric	
  current	
  to	
  flow	
  through	
  the	
  loop,	
  the	
  loop	
  must	
  not	
  contain	
  breaks.	
  In	
  other	
  words,	
  the	
  circuit	
  must	
  be	
  closed.	
  An	
  open	
  circuit	
  has	
  one	
  or	
  more	
  breaks.	
  Most	
  circuits	
  have	
  an	
  energy	
  source,	
  wires,	
  a	
  load,	
  and	
  a	
  switch.	
  As	
  mentioned,	
  energy	
  sources	
  for	
  circuits	
  include	
  generators	
  and	
  batteries.	
  Generators	
  are	
  machines	
  that	
  convert	
  mechanical	
  energyinto	
  electric	
  energy.	
  In	
  this	
  lesson,	
  we’ll	
  focus	
  on	
  batteries.
