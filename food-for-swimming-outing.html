                                            reputation as man-eaters because of many reported attacks. They are second only to the great white sharks in attacking people, but because they are not picky-eaters, they do not swim away after biting a human like the great whites frequently do. They are excellent scavengers; they have excellent senses of sight and smell and a nearly limitless menu of food choice. They have sharp, highly serrated teeth and powerful jaws that allow them to crack the shells of sea turtles and clams. The stomach contents of some captured tiger sharks have included stingrays, sea snakes, seals, birds, squids, and even non-food items like old tires and even license plates.
