Researchers are hoping to get emergency approval from regulators, whichwould allow them to make millions of vaccines by the fall. Oxford vaccines, thosewere effective over the last year, involved trials on macaque monkeys. Oxfordscientists hope to conduct thousands of clinical trials in the coming weeks; however,scientists are not sure that humans have the same immunity as monkeys. Sometimesit takes years to develop a vaccine and to make it available for patients. In case of avaccine for COVID-19, health officials have suggested that it could take between 12to 18 months.Summary OrganizerSomeoneWantsButSoThenSummary:make it summarize the story?​</a>

The letter is about his son, who wanted to go to school. He was hoping that the landlord, who he considered as compadre, will agree to accept his son as a boarder in order to attend school. They were very poor and the circumstances are against him. As he writes the letter, he looks at his child. The smells of poverty assail the father’s nostrils as he scratches out word after word, trying to look for the right words. He eventually remembers how the landlord, albeit generous with the rice, demanded twice its value at payback time. This gives him mixed emotions as he struggles with memories and tries to express himself for the sake of his son. He eventually finished the letter and asked the worker to deliver it to the landlord. The son was ery curious about the contents of this letter, and he finds a way to read the letter undetected. As he read the letter and realized what his father did to ensure his future, he feels a glow in his heart, and soon realizes that he is indeed, the happiest boy in the world.

                                            Let us look at some strategies/tricks that will help you summarize information. Summarizing Tricks In summarizing text, we can look at text features, vocabulary, and topic sentence to identify the most important details of the text. 1. Observe text features. Text features such as titles, subtitles, texture/size, color, margin notes, etc. are clues to a text's most important information --- information you may want to include in your summary. 2. Take note of highlighted vocabulary words. If a text gives you a list of important vocabulary in its preview, take note of these vocabulary words as they may be important information that should be included in your summary. 3. Identify the topic sentence. When reading a long text, identify the topic sentence in each paragraph. A topic sentence holds the most important information in a paragraph. Therefore, a summary can be written simply by synthesizing the topic sentences into your own words. 4. Use reporter's notes (Who? What? Where? When? Why? How?) Identify the answer to each of the above items. Take note of your answers, arrange them in a paragraph and you have a good summary. Elements of Text/Narrative 1. Setting-When and/or where it happened 2. Characters-people, animals or things playing an important role for the events 3. Plot-beginning, middle and ending events. 4.

Oxford vaccines, thosewere effective over the last year, involved trials on macaque monkeys. Oxfordscientists hope to conduct thousands of clinical trials in the coming weeks; however,scientists are not sure that humans have the same immunity as monkeys.

He issued a proclamation to have the elderly sent to Obatsuyama, or the mountain where "the aged are abandoned," and left to die.</p><p><strong>NEXT</strong>: A man and his elderly widowed mother resided in that country at the base of the mountain. The man was moved to send his cherished mother to the mountain after hearing the announcement.</p><p>His mother instructed him to follow the twigs she had laid on the ground while ascending the mountain right before he reached the summit and before climbing down.</p><p>He returned home with his mother and hid her beneath the floor where he cared for her since he could not bear to part with her.</p><p><strong>THEN</strong>: One day, the monarch wanted to show off his strength and ordered everyone, even his wisemen, to create an "ash rope." The son followed his mother's advice and used a twisted straw to create the rope, which he then burned on a row of flat stones on a windless night.</p><p>Knowing that he had help, he told the monarch that his mother's age and wisdom had enabled him to accomplish such an impossible task.</p><p><strong>Last</strong> but not least, the emperor initially imprisoned the guy but then changed his mind and quoted the proverb "With the crown of snow, there cometh wisdom! ”. As a result, the proclamation was revoked and the custom was discontinued.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><br />

The letter is about his son, who wanted to go to school. He was hoping that the landlord, who he considered as compadre, will agree to accept his son as a boarder in order to attend school. They were very poor and the circumstances are against him. As he writes the letter, he looks at his child. The smells of poverty assail the father’s nostrils as he scratches out word after word, trying to look for the right words. He eventually remembers how the landlord, albeit generous with the rice, demanded twice its value at payback time. This gives him mixed emotions as he struggles with memories and tries to express himself for the sake of his son. He eventually finished the letter and asked the worker to deliver it to the landlord. The son was ery curious about the contents of this letter, and he finds a way to read the letter undetected. As he read the letter and realized what his father did to ensure his future, he feels a glow in his heart, and soon realizes that he is indeed, the happiest boy in the world.
