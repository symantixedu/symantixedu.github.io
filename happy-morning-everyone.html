They had always been kind and good to everyone, but still they were not happy, because the child for which they longed had never come to them. Each day for many years they had prayed for a son or a daughter, but their prayers had been unanswered. Now that they were growing old they believed that they must always live alone.In the garden near their house this couple grew fine white squash, and as the vines bore the year around, they had never been in need of food. One day, however, they discovered that no new squash had formed to take the place of those they had picked, and for the first time in many seasons they had no vegetables.Each day they examined the vines, and though the big, yellow flowers continued to bloom and fade, no squash grew on the stems. Finally, one morning after a long wait, the woman cried out with delight, for she had discovered a little green squash. After examining it, they decided to let it ripen that they might have the seeds to plant. They eagerly watched it grow, and it became a beautiful white vegetable, but by the time it was large enough for food they were so hungry that they decided to eat it.They brought a large knife and picked it, but scarcely had they started to open it when a voice cried out from within, “Please be careful that you do not hurt me.”The man and woman stopped their work, for they thought that a spirit must have spoken to them. But when the voice again called and begged them to open the squash, they carefully opened it, and there inside was a nice baby boy. He could already stand alone and could talk. And the man and his wife were overjoyed.Presently the woman went to the spring for a jar of water, and when she had brought it she spread a mat on the floor and began to bathe the baby. As the drops of water fell off his body, they were immediately changed to gold, so that when the bath was finished gold pieces covered the mat. The couple had been so delighted to have the baby that it had seemed as if there was nothing more to wish for, but now that the gold had come to them also they were happier than ever.The next morning the woman gave the baby another bath, and again the water turned to gold. They now had enough money to build a large house. The third morning she brought water for his bath again, but he grew very sad and flew away. At the same time all the gold disappeared also, and the man and his wife were left poor and alone.pa answer kailangan kanapo kasi?​</a>

                                            Read the story. Then answer the questions. Miss Beth Bayless lived alone in an old timber house with a tiny garden in front. Her house had a steep roof which came down like a hat over the eyes of the windows. One day after shopping, as she fumbling in her purse for her front door key, she noticed a little plant growing in a crack in the concrete path. She put her basket and took a sharp knife. She pushed the knife down the side of the little plant and loosened it from the stony earth. It came up easily, roots and all. She hurried to get a trowel and dig a patch of earth near a verandah post. By next morning when Miss Bayless went out, the seedling had not only shot up over the stake, but had reached the verandah post. And the leaves! How richly green and glossy they were! Within a week, the plant had grown to the top of the post, and had even covered the inside of the verandah and begun spreading over the roof. She was fascinated with its speed, and with the way they seemed not to cover the windows and door, but just to frame them. She loved it. But the neighbours didn't. Mr. Drummond came, "Miss Bayless, I think you ought to take it out before it does some serious damage." Don't worry, Mr. Drummond, I'm not at all concerned." Everyone in the street came to stare the creepers. Next morning, as she opened the door, she smelt the most delicious scent. And there was the fruit a rosy golden ripe ball! She twisted it off the vine and gently cut open. Oh! It was the most mouth-watering taste of her life! And the delicious smell reminded Miss Bayless of her childhood. Her mind raced back to thoughts of those happy carefree days. Five boys and girls, full of smiles, and eyes shining, crowded around her. Then she led the way to the backyard, and the fun began! All day long, they run and climbed trees, and had a picnic. As soon as the sun dipped down over the old walnut tree, she could imagine her five friends saying goodbye. "I wonder," Miss Bayless said aloud, "will children come today?" Answer each question. 1. Who was Miss Beth Bayless and how was her house? 2. What did Miss Bayless notice when she came back from shopping? 3. What did Miss Bayless do then? 4. What happened by the next morning? 5. How the plant had grown? 6. What happened when she opened the door? Ceau alichlian co​</a>

She doesn't have a hometown, and she won't ever have life-long friends. She has never been in one place The fist thing that strikes you about Katherine is her smile. It is by no means a perfect smile it isn't even close. It's how easily that smile comes that makes it so special. A glance from a nearby stranger will earn a broad smile. A smile will get a heartfelt grin, and agrin receives such laughing smiles that most people turn around after they've past and shake their heads with concem. This is a story about saying goodbye and then turning around and saying hello. It's about moving it's about change. It's about daily life in the Air Force. Each move means another house and different friends. Different rules and different cultures A simple smile helps Katherine through this change. Her joy is seeing others feel joy. Her happiness is helping others know happiness. She is dependent. Without others, her life would be hollow. Empty Who is Katherine Wamer? She is a self-confident, yet shy little girl whose father is in the Air Force She's moved so many times before that this should be routine, but each time it gets harder and harder. She just can't say goodbye anymore. She doesn't want to go, but it is a warm, summer morning, but everyone inside the brick house is feeling cold. The children are aroused and teeth are brushed. Sleeping bags are rolled and stuffed in the car. Nothing remains except a few memories. Mom and Dad help the children into the car and get them buckled. They then climb into their own seats and say "Well adjust." But everyone's eyes are wet. "Why Alabama?" "What could be in Alabama? But there's no going back. The orders came. We move. Neighbors wave goodbye and friends turn away to hide their tears. Katherine presses her nose against the car window and watches the people slowly falling away behind. Suddenly her best trend Katie breaks into a run and starts chasing the car. She waves and laughs, but the tears still fall. Katherine doesn't notice the tears. She smiles and waves, and realizes that her parents were right. She​</a>

Whether the clouds finally share its load to the ground or the sun thinks it is the only star, everyone is always under the weather. You remember one rainy Talamban morning and feathers clinging on wings made for false progress and resilience, silent flight above heights. You remember that late afternoon you called your apartment home because the loved closed its door for you. With tree-barren mountains and construction here and there, you ask if you are building a life. No cloud is drying, no soil is not harsh. Living means remembering breathing spaces in which no one but you crash to make a point. Then the city presents itself on a star-filled night devoid of the color black yet not of the dark unfolding it's never-enough narrow roads with your story to tell, unsettled dust just around and the dead-end street happiness.NOTEBOOK From the poem answer the following questions. 1. How does the author describe the city? 2. What words did she use to describe it? 3. Do you agree with the author's description? Why? 4. What do you have in mind as you read the poem? Use any appropriate multimedia to share the idea you have. Send it to your teacher when you're done.​</a>

They had always been kind and good to everyone, but still they were not happy, because the child for which they longed had never come to them. Each day for many years they had prayed for a son or a daughter, but their prayers had been unanswered. Now that they were growing old they believed that they must always live alone.In the garden near their house this couple grew fine white squash, and as the vines bore the year around, they had never been in need of food. One day, however, they discovered that no new squash had formed to take the place of those they had picked, and for the first time in many seasons they had no vegetables.Each day they examined the vines, and though the big, yellow flowers continued to bloom and fade, no squash grew on the stems. Finally, one morning after a long wait, the woman cried out with delight, for she had discovered a little green squash. After examining it, they decided to let it ripen that they might have the seeds to plant. They eagerly watched it grow, and it became a beautiful white vegetable, but by the time it was large enough for food they were so hungry that they decided to eat it.They brought a large knife and picked it, but scarcely had they started to open it when a voice cried out from within, “Please be careful that you do not hurt me.”The man and woman stopped their work, for they thought that a spirit must have spoken to them. But when the voice again called and begged them to open the squash, they carefully opened it, and there inside was a nice baby boy. He could already stand alone and could talk. And the man and his wife were overjoyed.Presently the woman went to the spring for a jar of water, and when she had brought it she spread a mat on the floor and began to bathe the baby. As the drops of water fell off his body, they were immediately changed to gold, so that when the bath was finished gold pieces covered the mat. The couple had been so delighted to have the baby that it had seemed as if there was nothing more to wish for, but now that the gold had come to them also they were happier than ever.The next morning the woman gave the baby another bath, and again the water turned to gold. They now had enough money to build a large house. The third morning she brought water for his bath again, but he grew very sad and flew away. At the same time all the gold disappeared also, and the man and his wife were left poor and alone.pa answer kailangan kanapo kasi?​</h2><br />

                            22. Read the story. Then answer the questions. Miss Beth Bayless lived alone in an old timber house with a tiny garden in front. Her house had a steep roof which came down like a hat over the eyes of the windows. One day after shopping, as she fumbling in her purse for her front door key, she noticed a little plant growing in a crack in the concrete path. She put her basket and took a sharp knife. She pushed the knife down the side of the little plant and loosened it from the stony earth. It came up easily, roots and all. She hurried to get a trowel and dig a patch of earth near a verandah post. By next morning when Miss Bayless went out, the seedling had not only shot up over the stake, but had reached the verandah post. And the leaves! How richly green and glossy they were! Within a week, the plant had grown to the top of the post, and had even covered the inside of the verandah and begun spreading over the roof. She was fascinated with its speed, and with the way they seemed not to cover the windows and door, but just to frame them. She loved it. But the neighbours didn't. Mr. Drummond came, "Miss Bayless, I think you ought to take it out before it does some serious damage." Don't worry, Mr. Drummond, I'm not at all concerned." Everyone in the street came to stare the creepers. Next morning, as she opened the door, she smelt the most delicious scent. And there was the fruit a rosy golden ripe ball! She twisted it off the vine and gently cut open. Oh! It was the most mouth-watering taste of her life! And the delicious smell reminded Miss Bayless of her childhood. Her mind raced back to thoughts of those happy carefree days. Five boys and girls, full of smiles, and eyes shining, crowded around her. Then she led the way to the backyard, and the fun began! All day long, they run and climbed trees, and had a picnic. As soon as the sun dipped down over the old walnut tree, she could imagine her five friends saying goodbye. "I wonder," Miss Bayless said aloud, "will children come today?" Answer each question. 1. Who was Miss Beth Bayless and how was her house? 2. What did Miss Bayless notice when she came back from shopping? 3. What did Miss Bayless do then? 4. What happened by the next morning? 5. How the plant had grown? 6.

She doesn't have a hometown, and she won't ever have life-long friends. She has never been in one place The fist thing that strikes you about Katherine is her smile. It is by no means a perfect smile it isn't even close. It's how easily that smile comes that makes it so special. A glance from a nearby stranger will earn a broad smile. A smile will get a heartfelt grin, and agrin receives such laughing smiles that most people turn around after they've past and shake their heads with concem. This is a story about saying goodbye and then turning around and saying hello. It's about moving it's about change. It's about daily life in the Air Force. Each move means another house and different friends. Different rules and different cultures A simple smile helps Katherine through this change. Her joy is seeing others feel joy. Her happiness is helping others know happiness. She is dependent. Without others, her life would be hollow. Empty Who is Katherine Wamer? She is a self-confident, yet shy little girl whose father is in the Air Force She's moved so many times before that this should be routine, but each time it gets harder and harder. She just can't say goodbye anymore. She doesn't want to go, but it is a warm, summer morning, but everyone inside the brick house is feeling cold. The children are aroused and teeth are brushed. Sleeping bags are rolled and stuffed in the car. Nothing remains except a few memories. Mom and Dad help the children into the car and get them buckled. They then climb into their own seats and say "Well adjust." But everyone's eyes are wet. "Why Alabama?" "What could be in Alabama? But there's no going back. The orders came. We move. Neighbors wave goodbye and friends turn away to hide their tears. Katherine presses her nose against the car window and watches the people slowly falling away behind. Suddenly her best trend Katie breaks into a run and starts chasing the car. She waves and laughs, but the tears still fall. Katherine doesn't notice the tears. She smiles and waves, and realizes that her parents were right. She​</h2><br />

                            27.                       "City Lines"                       Andrea Lim Tangled electric cables are always part of the sky's scenes, The day looks owned by many and conquered by some, Maya claws holding thin lines. Whether the clouds finally share its load to the ground or the sun thinks it is the only star, everyone is always under the weather. You remember one rainy Talamban morning and feathers clinging on wings made for false progress and resilience, silent flight above heights. You remember that late afternoon you called your apartment home because the loved closed its door for you. With tree-barren mountains and construction here and there, you ask if you are building a life. No cloud is drying, no soil is not harsh. Living means remembering breathing spaces in which no one but you crash to make a point. Then the city presents itself on a star-filled night devoid of the color black yet not of the dark unfolding it's never-enough narrow roads with your story to tell, unsettled dust just around and the dead-end street happiness.NOTEBOOK From the poem answer the following questions. 1. How does the author describe the city? 2. What words did she use to describe it? 3. Do you agree with the author's description? Why? 4. What do you have in mind as you read the poem?
