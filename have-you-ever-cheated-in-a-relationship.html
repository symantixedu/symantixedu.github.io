                        No, I never cheated, and, to be honest, nobody ever should. <p></p><p>If you feel personal that you are attracted to other people and are unable to resist your temptations, then stop the relationship with whomever you are with gracefully and DO WHATEVER YOU WISH AFTER THAT. Cheating on someone shows the other person a great deal of disrespect. More times than you can imagine, I've been cheated on. One lesson persisted through all of those events. "If they can't respect themselves, how will they respect you," was the lesson learned. In other words, <strong>act responsibly and express your emotions openly</strong>.</p><p></p><p>A big element of <strong>loyalty </strong>is honoring your commitments and never betraying them, which is crucial in a partnership. The connection can be strengthened and your goals can be reached by doing everything in your power to keep the promise you made. Make careful, nevertheless, that the commitments you make are reasonable.</p><p></p>This article will go over some advice on how to be a faithful partner in a relationship to assist them:Realize that you chose to be in a relationship; it wasn't just an option.Value and respect your partner's contribution to your life.First, talk about relationship concerns with your partner.You should never fall in love with someone else.Don't give up on the person you love lightly.Never renege on a significant commitment.Give your connection to one of your top priorities.Speak with your partner before making significant decisions.Give up attempting to find happiness in other people.Encourage your partner to feel desired.Be honest about your feelings.<p></p><p><strong>Learn more about honesty here: https://brainly.ph/question/6191292</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

Sa tingin ko, ang ibig nilang sabihin ay kapag ang isang taong pinagkakatiwalaan mo ay nagtaksil sa iyo, mas masakit ito kaysa sa ibang mga taong nagtataksil sa iyo. Sa palagay ko ay hindi ko masasabi na alam ko ang pakiramdam na iyon dahil hindi ko kailanman naranasan o nakuha ang pagtataksil sa aking kaibigan at pamilya ngunit narinig ko ang mga kuwento na sinabi sa akin ng mga tao.

                        <p><strong>Yes, I've been in trouble because someone caught me cheating.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>What happened?</strong></p><p>It happened when I was in the 3rd grade of middle school. I sat in seat number two from the back. Since I forgot there was an exam that day and I hadn't studied, I prepared a small note and put it in my pocket. When the teacher didn't see I opened it and tried to find an answer. But my friend saw that and told my teacher. My test paper was taken and I automatically got zero points. I also got punished and my teacher told my parents. When I got home I was also scolded again by my mother.</p><p></p><p><strong>What do I wish happened?</strong></p><p>I hope that at that time I didn't have thoughts of cheating so that I wouldn't be scolded and get zero points. Now that I think about it, I'd rather get a low score than cheat. After all, it's a consequence because I didn't prepare for my exam well.</p><p></p><p><strong>What did I learn from it?</strong></p>Cheating is a bad thing and I hope we all don't do it again.Cheating will only provide temporary convenience, but if you get used to it, it will harm us because it will make us not learn anything.My mother said that she was very disappointed that I wasn't honest and that it made me think that I didn't want to cheat and disappoint my parents again.I learned that I have to be more careful with my schedule so I don't forget to study and prepare for my exam.<p></p><p><strong>Learn more about English</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/3023239</p><p><strong>#SPJ5</strong></p><br />

                            7. Activity 3.2: Mindfulness with Reflection: Answer the following questions. Write it on a one whole sheet of paper. 1. Does someone ever ask you a question that you really didn't want to answer? How did you respond? 2. Have you ever gotten (or give) a "compliment" that really wasn't a compliment? How did you feel afterwards? 3. Did you ever do something to be helpful that turned out badly? What happened? What do you wish had happened? 4.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. You should simply say that you don't know the answer their question or if you're not okay with their question, just say you're uncomfortable with it. You should always be straight to the point. </p><p></p><p>2. If it was a backhanded compliment, then you should ignore their "compliment" and think of it like just one of those nonsense talking. You should be confident if you're receiving those kind of compliments. I would feel a little upset but would move on and forget what they said. </p><p></p><p>3. Yes. Things didn't turned out the way it should be so I end up apologizing for it. I wish that we could start over again and not fail it this time. </p><p></p><p>4. Yes, but i never said anything but only told them both goodbye since they're not worth my energy. I am worth more than a dime and i know what i deserve. </p><p></p><p>5. No, i never cheated to anyone before. Everything turned out okay after a little explanation and clarifications. </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>None. </p><br />

                            12. Have you ever caught someone cheating (either on a test or on a boyfriend/girlfriend)? Did you say anything? Why or why not?</h2><br />
                        <p>Yes, I caught someone cheating on an test before. I think a lot of students may have experienced cheating (including myself) during an exam. I’m not saying that it’s something that a student should experience because this is really a bad habit. Anyway, I never had the chance to tell on this person because one of the professors caught her so he gave her a disciplinary action and re-take a special exam instead. Good thing I haven’t witnessed a friend or someone cheating on her boy/girlfriend. But if that happens, I know it’s not that easy to do, then I have to be honest to my friend to not waste his/her time to someone who’s not worthy.</p>If I ever caught someone cheating, I have to confront the person (especially if it is my life, work/studies, friend, relative, or student and/or it will affect me, a friend, a relative, or an institution).<br /><br /><br /><br />For everyone's information, here's how a professional proctor should handle a situation when someone's cheating on exam (According to By Rachel Tustin): <br /><br /><br />1. Document the Event - When you see a student cheating during an exam, it stirs a lot of emotions inside you. While your impulse as a teacher may be to stage a teacher rant in the middle of the exam, you have to keep a cool head and proceed calmly.<p><br /></p>2. Have a Conversation - Your next step is to set aside time, preferably as soon as possible, to discuss the situation with the student. Ideally, you will want a third party to sit in on the meeting if possible. This person is essentially there to witness what was said should you need it later. It can be a fellow teacher or an administrator.<br /><br /><p>It is not a good idea to accuse a student of cheating right off the bat in the conversation. Keep in mind that, due to a difference in perception, they may not realize what they were doing was wrong.<br /><br /></p>3. Talk to the Parents - Your next steps often depend on your school's policy. In some cases, schools have clear cut guidelines in regards to cheating as part of their honor codes. Consequences could be a zero on a test, suspension, or other disciplinary action.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why some pupils cheat? - https://brainly.ph/question/1044198<br />

                            28. Have you ever caught someone cheating either on a test or on a boyfriend/girlfriend? Did you say anything? Why or why not?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yes, I onced witnessed one of my classmates that she had been cheated on our Science summative test then I approached her during our vacant time and I adviced her that it is better to have a failed marks as long as you're honest because yourself is the one who makes you worser. Instead of rumoring or sharing this scenario to my other classmates it is better to say on that person personally.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> nung grade 8 kami by the way she thanked me on that and I became onced a hero on my life guys :))</p><p></p><br />

                            29. Have you ever gotten in trouble because someone caught you cheating (or thought you were cheating)? What happened? What do you wish had happened?</h2><br />
                        <p>If indeed I <strong>cheated</strong> and got caught by other people, then there's not much I can do. Maybe my test paper is taken and then I'm told to leave the class and can't take the exam.</p><p>But if in reality I'm not cheating and someone thinks I'm cheating, I will deny that and stick to the honesty that I'm not cheating. I hope that in such a situation, there are witnesses or evidence such as CCTV who can defend and show that I am not cheating.</p><p></p>The bad effects of cheating<p>1. <strong>Lack of self-assurance</strong></p><p>Basically, cheating behavior aims to make it easier for you to solve problems question by question. Consciously or not, this behavior confirms that you do not have the confidence to fill out the answers, so that you inevitably have to act fraudulently.</p><p>In addition to violating school rules, cheating can bring about such a bad habit for you. Losing confidence is not an easy matter; returning it is not as easy as we imagine.</p><p>2. <strong>You will struggle to solve your own problems.</strong></p><p>Why should there be cheating behavior. Well, because you can't finish what you're doing, look for answers from friends or from books that have been previously provided.</p><p>If you can't solve problem after problem, how can you solve life's complicated problems? The habit of cheating can carry over into adulthood, but you know, you can't do it continuously.</p><p>3.<strong>Make us lazy</strong></p><p>When you cheat and succeed in doing it many times, the sure thing that will happen to you is that you are too lazy to study, especially in the context of memorizing, because you don't have to think about doing the questions.</p><p>So, don't make cheating your habit at the time of the exam. The bad impact can happen to yourself at the time of the exam, which will damage your future later.</p><p>4. <strong>You lie to your own values, including your parents</strong></p><p>When you get good grades from cheating, isn't that the same as lying about the grades you get as well as your parents. So, don't let you lie to yourself, your grades, your teachers, and your parents, who have been struggling to pay school fees all this time.</p><p> </p><p>Learn information about the bad effects of cheating https://brainly.ph/question/7523974.</p><p>#SPJ5</p><br />
