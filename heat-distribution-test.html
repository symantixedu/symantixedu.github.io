Write answers before each number.1. The internal heat of Earth fuels the planet's dynamic processes including platemovements, earthquakes, and volcanism.2. The great amount of kinetic energy is produced by the accreting objects which werethen converted to heat energy.3. Rotational velocity is directly proportional to radius.4. Collapsed clouds occur because accretion of more materials led to an increase in thegravity causing the contraction of Earth.5. The collapsed cloud resulted in the conversion of gravitational energy into heat energy.6. Unstable elements undergo radioactive decay.7. The process of radioactive decay produces heat as a byproduct.8. Earth's thermal budget is the measure of the amount of heat that is released at thesurface and produced in the interior.9. The 30% of the solar energy that reaches the surface of Earth is absorbed by the clouds,atmosphere and light-colored areas.10. The reflected energy drives wind and ocean currents. These currents distribute the heatthroughout the planet since more sunlight shines on the equatorial region than polarregions.​</a>

Write answers before each number.1. The internal heat of Earth fuels the planet's dynamic processes including platemovements, earthquakes, and volcanism.2. The great amount of kinetic energy is produced by the accreting objects which werethen converted to heat energy.3. Rotational velocity is directly proportional to radius.4. Collapsed clouds occur because accretion of more materials led to an increase in thegravity causing the contraction of Earth.5. The collapsed cloud resulted in the conversion of gravitational energy into heat energy.6. Unstable elements undergo radioactive decay.7. The process of radioactive decay produces heat as a byproduct.8. Earth's thermal budget is the measure of the amount of heat that is released at thesurface and produced in the interior.9. The 30% of the solar energy that reaches the surface of Earth is absorbed by the clouds,atmosphere and light-colored areas.10. The reflected energy drives wind and ocean currents. These currents distribute the heatthroughout the planet since more sunlight shines on the equatorial region than polarregions.​</h2><br />
