In order for us to overcome those challenging moments, we should think that we can face and overcome those problems even only by ourselves because if we wouldn't, we might lose our confidence that would lead for us to not overcome those problems. And even though we know that we can do that all by ourselves, we should still put ourselves in God's hands because without him, we couldn't do anything successfully.</p><br />

My life has not become easier. If anything it has become more of a challenge. Not sure exactly why this is. Either it's because I deal with more variet of issues every day than I used to or because I deal with more things period than I used to. And as far as overcoming anything I would venture to say that nothing is ever truly overcome. It merely changes and more into what appears to be something different but is still more of the same.</p><p></p><p>92 views</p><p></p><p>View 1 Upvoter</p><p></p><p>Mark Williams, studied at University of West Florida (2016)</p><p></p><p>Answered December 5, 2017</p><p></p><p>Originally Answered: How did you overcome the hardest times of your life?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues is a huge part of my Christian life. Without getting into a long theological explanation I will just state the facts as I know them. Every Christian should be baptized in the Holy Spirit as that is the way God intended them to operate. Speaking in tongues for personal edification is a powerful tool that can greatly aid your spiritual life as God intended it to do. By praying in a spirit language that you do not know the meaning of and yet communicate to God directly, one is able to pray smoothly and clearly without interruptions.
</p><p>
</p><p>To explain this I can say that I can pray for all my family, friends, church, country, job, elected officials, charities, missionaries, causes big and small in about five minutes. But to continue in prayer language I can pray for thirty minutes or an hour off and on throughout the day and it wont bring any mental fatigue whatsoever as my spirit is praying directly to God.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po tnx</p><br />

                        <p>I remember the time when I experienced a very difficult moral dilemma it was when I found a wallet on the street with a large sum of money in it, along with the owner's identification. I was facing a moral dilemma, whether to keep the money or return it to the rightful owner. On one hand, keeping the money would provide temporary financial relief, but it would also involve dishonesty and taking something that does not belong to me. On the other hand, returning the wallet to the owner would be the honest and ethical thing to do, but I may also worry about the possibility of being accused of taking some of the money or being viewed as a naive person for not taking the money.</p><p></p><p>I overcame this dilemma, by considering various options, such as taking the wallet to the local police station, contacting the owner directly, or leaving the wallet at a lost and found office. In doing so, I was making a conscious effort to do the right thing, despite the potential consequences or difficulties involved.</p><p></p><p>The lesson learned from this experience is that doing the right thing is not always easy, but it is always worth it in the long run. Being honest and ethical, even when it is difficult, helps to build one's reputation, integrity, and character. It also contributes to creating a more trustworthy and just society.</p><br />

In order for us to overcome those challenging moments, we should think that we can face and overcome those problems even only by ourselves because if we wouldn't, we might lose our confidence that would lead for us to not overcome those problems. And even though we know that we can do that all by ourselves, we should still put ourselves in God's hands because without him, we couldn't do anything successfully.</p><p></p><br />

This is very much the reason you often see individuals go through drastic changes when dealing with the passing of a loved one, a divorce, or even a near-death experience. This isn’t meant to trivialize the seriousness of such experiences; it’s a suggestion that we try to view them as more than simply negative.<br /><br />The key is to understand the power of these emotions and channel that energy towards growth. Modern neurosciences show that we actually have the capacity to change the form and function of our brains (neuroplasticity). At no time is this ability greater or more critical than when the energy of adversity is in our lives. In simple terms, individuals who use adversity to evolve are those that experience the most joy and success.<br /><br />When you encounter adversity, understand that with it comes great opportunity. True, some situations are unavoidably dark. Just do your best to view them as chances to evolve and grow.<br /><br />See with greater clarity by letting the dust settle<br /><br />One of my favorite verses of the Tao Te Ching is about dealing with adversity. While I’ve read many translations, the basic message is that facing difficult situations is like looking into a cup of dirty water. Lao Tzu, the author, challenges us to have the patience to allow the dirt to settle so that we can see through the water clearly.<br /><br />While it is important to take action in the face of adversity, it is more important to act from a place of strength. Too often, we act quickly and compound the problems in our lives. The best form of action is to process the problem while remaining calm, gaining perspective and building clarity and certainty. Can you allow the dirt to settle so you can see through the glass clearly?<br /><br />Maintain composure through compartmentalizing<br /><br />I know that my biggest mistake when things go awry in one area of my life is allowing that to affect other parts of my life as well. A bad morning at home as a father can easily spill over into my time at the office, as well as impact what I eat and how I take care of myself. On those days, it feels like I can’t do anything right, and it’s true, I can’t, because I’m not compartmentalizing my problems.<br /><br />Overcoming ChallengesDon’t allow problems to expand and steamroll through everything in your life. In fact, stability in one area can be a source of strength and the foundation from which to make corrections in others.<br /><br />I suggest creating separation between different components of your life. Take time after work to re-set your energy and attention on your personal or family time. Likewise, when things are going wrong, make sure to focus on getting enough sleep, eating healthy and getting the exercise you need regardless of the difficulties.<br /><br />Give yourself a win by doing something productive<br /><br />The worst thing you can do in an adverse situation is disengage. Retreating to comfort in the form of food, shopping or some other habitual response is not just destructive to you personally, it often takes you deeper into the hole when the immediate gratification is gone.<br /><br />Overcoming ChallengesI have found that the positive gratification of an accomplishment is often just what I need to reengage with life. When I have anxiety, the simple process of creating a budget, taking my kids to the park or washing the laundry gets me back into productivity mode. To be honest, balancing our budget is probably one of the biggest challenges of all. We live in a very busy household and therefore our utility bills can often seem daunting as we end up using a lot of electricity to keep our home running. However, when it comes to paying off your energy bills, it is fundamental that you take time to check out other policies and compare your options to make sure that you are getting the best deal for your money. I know a few people who have managed to save money by switching to energy providers such as Pennywise Power. <br /><br />
