the country – Juba, South Judan 
“The human race shall always overcome,” 
said Jommo Kenyatta 
See, I am the ultimate test 
How well do you work together? How 
well coordinated are you? 
Covid 19 is my name 
I know no boundaries or lanes 
No celebrity can match my fame 
Like a roaring flame I engulf all on my path 
The poor and the rich both feel my wrath 
You have a common enemy in me So, 
lower your guns and focus on mellower 
your rank, tribe, ethnicity and focus on me 
For can’t you see, can’t you see 
I know off no hierarchy 
My presence brings fear and anarchy 
I stronger than Samson 
For I break the unbreakable 
I’ll break your economy 
I’ll break your faith 
But that’s only if you let me 
For the racism you show only strengthens me 
You like hiding your identity, then wear a 
mask 
You claim that your hands are clean, then 
sanitize 
For the death I cause is no man’s fault but 
rather my nature 
You shall overcome me; it’s in your blood, it’s 
your nature 
I am no professor, neither is this a lecture 
As nations cower in fear 
For I grab many victims in a day For 
once they see something worse than war 
For once they see humanity is worth 
fighting for 
What goes up must come down 
No authority is higher than me 
For I break the laws of traditions 
I break the laws of a normal condition 
But I’ll never break the so-called men 
Bend them to their breaking points 
Once they kill me, they forget my wrath 
and once again I’ll strike 
As you suffer because of me Also try 
and learn from me and your 
mistakes 
As I go down the books of history 
Still there’s more to come 
Maintain the togetherness And 
there will be no harm 
Share the little you have 
Before I strike and leave you with none 
The only way to survive me, is by joining 
heads 
Lock your doors for I roam the streets 
Stay alert for like an assassin; you never 
know my target. 
But only working together can tame my

This can be used as a guide if you ever encounter a situation where you would need to provide counseling to another person 1. Building Rapport / Strengths Could you tell me some things about yourself? What do you enjoy doing? What are you good at? Describe what an awesome day would be like for you. What would the important people in your life say what is awesome about you? What do you enjoy learning about? 2. Goals How will you know that meeting here today was helpful? How would you know that coming here was worth your time? What do you hope to get out of visiting here today? What do you hope to see happen instead of what is bothering you? 3. Miracle Question If you could wave a magic wand and things changed, how would you know magic has happened? What would be different? What would you be doing differently that showed you your hopes came true? What else would be different? What other changes would you experience? Who would notice a change had happened? What would they see? 4. Exceptions to the Problem &amp; Competencies When are the times that "the problem is not such a problem? What is different? When does the problem" not bother you so much? How have you managed so far to deal with the problem" What has helped so far? Even if it has been just a little help. How have you found the courage to deal with this problem? 5. Scaling On a scale of 10 to 0, where 10 means your hope and goal has come true and O is the worst you can imagine, what number are you now? How will you know you have moved up one number? What will one number higher look like? How would you be able to move up one point? 6. Closure / Plan / What will you try differently or do more of when you leave today? What experiment can you try out? What is the best thing you noticed about yourself today?​​</a>

                            20. A. Directions: Read and comprehend the poem “Covid 19” by Steven Kiama Ambrose from 
the country – Juba, South Judan 
“The human race shall always overcome,” 
said Jommo Kenyatta 
See, I am the ultimate test 
How well do you work together? How 
well coordinated are you? 
Covid 19 is my name 
I know no boundaries or lanes 
No celebrity can match my fame 
Like a roaring flame I engulf all on my path 
The poor and the rich both feel my wrath 
You have a common enemy in me So, 
lower your guns and focus on mellower 
your rank, tribe, ethnicity and focus on me 
For can’t you see, can’t you see 
I know off no hierarchy 
My presence brings fear and anarchy 
I stronger than Samson 
For I break the unbreakable 
I’ll break your economy 
I’ll break your faith 
But that’s only if you let me 
For the racism you show only strengthens me 
You like hiding your identity, then wear a 
mask 
You claim that your hands are clean, then 
sanitize 
For the death I cause is no man’s fault but 
rather my nature 
You shall overcome me; it’s in your blood, it’s 
your nature 
I am no professor, neither is this a lecture 
As nations cower in fear 
For I grab many victims in a day For 
once they see something worse than war 
For once they see humanity is worth 
fighting for 
What goes up must come down 
No authority is higher than me 
For I break the laws of traditions 
I break the laws of a normal condition 
But I’ll never break the so-called men 
Bend them to their breaking points 
Once they kill me, they forget my wrath 
and once again I’ll strike 
As you suffer because of me Also try 
and learn from me and your 
mistakes 
As I go down the books of history 
Still there’s more to come 
Maintain the togetherness And 
there will be no harm 
Share the little you have 
Before I strike and leave you with none 
The only way to survive me, is by joining 
heads 
Lock your doors for I roam the streets 
Stay alert for like an assassin; you never 
know my target. 
But only working together can tame my
