Just put a checkmark () on the answer that you most relate with. Write your answers in your notebook. 1. Will you feel worried if you hear that one of your teachers has become gravely ill? Yes No 2. I don't know what to feel. If your uncle suddenly barged in your home and started picking a fight with your mother or father, how do you think is your uncle feeling? He must be content. He must be angry. I'm not sure how he is feeling. 3. You learn that the purchase you made at a clothing store comes with two cinema tickets to your much-awaited film. How would you feel? I would feel excited. I would feel doubtful. I would feel burdened.​</a>

She hummed a happy tune while walking. As she went along, she began thinking of what she would do with the money she would get for the milk. "I'll buy some chicken from Mang Tomas," she said, "and they will lay eggs each morning, then I will sell the eggs to the mayor's wife. With the money that I will get from the sale of the eggs, I'm sure I can buy myself a cute dress and a hat; and when I go to the market I would be a muse. Won't all the young men come up and speak to me! Ana will be that jealous, but I don't care. I shall just look at her and toss my head like this." As she spoke, she tossed her head back, the pail fell down, and all the milk was spilled. She had to go home and tell her mother what happened. Talk about it 1. What did Mutya plan to buy with her money? 2 When did she stop thinking about her plans? 3. How did she feel about the spilt milk? 4 How do you think her mother feel? 5. What advice do you think did her mother give her? 6. If you were Mutya, what would you do? 7. How can Mutya realize her plans? &amp; How can you realize your own plans?​</a>

                            3. You have had one piece of cake and your stomach feels full. Someone offers you another piece.
Q1: How does your body react to this situation? I will tell 
Q2: How would you feel? I feel full 
Q3: Is it going to be easy or difficult to practice self-control?
Q4: If it becomes hard, what do you think can make it easier?
Please help me.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>(Answer) Q1: In this situation, the body may send signals of fullness, such as a feeling of discomfort or a lack of hunger, to the brain. This may cause the person to feel less inclined to eat more food, including the second piece of cake.</p><p></p><p>(Answer) Q2: If someone offers me another piece of cake when I feel full, I would likely decline the offer since I don't feel like eating more at the moment.</p><p></p><p>(Answer) Q3: Practicing self-control in this situation could be easy or difficult depending on the individual's level of self-discipline, their personal goals, and their relationship with food. For some people, declining the second piece of cake may be a simple matter of listening to their body's signals of fullness and being satisfied with what they have already eaten. However, for others, it may be challenging to resist the temptation of indulging in more food, especially if they have a sweet tooth or have difficulty with portion control.</p><p></p><p>(Answer) Q4: To make it easier to practice self-control in this situation, one could remind themselves of their personal health goals, the potential negative effects of overeating, or the importance of listening to their body's signals. Additionally, finding alternative ways to indulge in a sweet treat, such as enjoying a small piece of fruit or a healthier dessert option, could help satisfy cravings without overindulging. Engaging in activities such as taking a walk or doing something enjoyable could also distract from the desire to eat more food.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Do you think that we can make a better world if we intersubjective relationships over economic progress? Defend your answer prioritize​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. There will always be instances where we'll feel like we are treated as an object by our family, loved ones or people around us. This can be when our feelings are being misunderstood and is not being taken into considderation or when our worth is not being appreciated and is not being given of importance.</p><p></p><p>This kind of situation will surely make us feel anxious and sometimes will make us think that we are not loved and alone. However, this would not be a valid reason for us to treat people the same way. We, as a children of God and as humans, should always observe respect and love one another. We should always do good to people no matter how bad they treat us sometimes. Showing goodness to people no matter how they treat us is really important. Treating each and every one of us in a nice way is the right thing to do. Just like what the bible says, we should love one another and by this, we can say that treating people as an object is not a good thing to do. Lastly, our treatment to other people should not depend on how they treat us.</p><p></p><p>2. It depends</p><p>it depends if I'm being treated as a "bad" subject or "good" subject</p><p></p><p>If it's a bad subject I would be annoyed so I wouldn't do it to others.. But if it's good then I'd be fine with and it and to other people</p><p></p><p>3. They regard other people as objects, they don't value the other persons feelings. They lack empathy. If someone you liked is treating you that way then it means they have no respect for you, which may be something you find it hard to accept, but you should accept it and leave this person.</p><p></p><p>4. What comes in my mind is like treating them as a means. Treating or using someone "merely as a means" means that the person is using another person simply to get what they want out of the situation. Basically, they're not doing the action for someone else, but using them for their own purposes.</p><p></p><p>5. We can make a better world if we prioritize intersubjective relationships over economic progress because the economy needs people and people need to have a good relationship with others. Therefore, we can communicate well with others and economic progress will continue to prosper.</p><p></p><br />

                        Problem in Virtual Class<p></p><p><strong>1. Using visual aids and interactive tools</strong> is one of the simplest things to do in a virtual classroom. <strong>Programs for video conferencing, </strong>digital whiteboards, and screen sharing are a few examples of this. </p><p><strong>By utilizing these resource</strong>s, students can take an active part in their education by seeing what their teachers and peers are talking about. These resources can also assist in improving how interesting and pleasurable the learning experience is for the pupils.</p><p><strong>2.

Instructors could use online forums</strong> or discussion boards to allow students to engage with each other and build relationships.

It might also help to talk to my parent and explain how my sibling's behavior made me feel. Additionally, finding a healthy outlet for my emotions, such as talking to a friend or engaging in a relaxing activity, can also help me regain my composure and prevent me from acting impulsively.</p><p></p><p><strong>I'm sorry, I can't answer the question 1 because it needs to be your own answer. </strong></p><p><strong>I'm sorry, I can't answer the question 1 because it needs to be your own answer.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Life is full of surprises, you never know what will happen if you wont explore. That's what i did, when i took another career &amp; had a boyfriend &amp; got pregnant.It was full of happiness &amp; inspiration everyday, until I found out it wasn't just me. Then all started to fell apart.</p><p></p><p>I was hesitant to tell my family, but I am the kind of person that is very open. I was excited to be a mom! I was scared, that's expected, right?! But to my surprise, she was just quiet. Not a single word to expect.</p><p></p><p>I like to imagine that the words will be like a big machine gun! But not at all, instead, i got all the love &amp; support from my entire family. Absolutely amazing! Shockingly true love &amp; unexpectedly tears of joy. </p><p></p><p>That is why to this day, my respect to my family is so high up! Even if my baby's dad is no longer in the picture, my child grew up as an amazing woman she is now. A smart, loving &amp; ideal lady. I raised her well with the support of my family &amp; with God all the time. Im so blessed!</p><p></p><br />
