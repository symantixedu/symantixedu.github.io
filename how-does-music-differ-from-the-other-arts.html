Rather, it seeks to express ideas or images related to antiquity or some "primitive" culture or attitude. Primitivism can also be understood as a late development of 19th-century nationalism.</p><p></p><p>In music, primitivism indicates an elevation of rhythm to a place of prominence, and the best early example of this movement is Stravinsky's Le Sacre du Printemps, completed in 1912. The work breaks with old rhythm-phrase accent structures, favouring violent asymmetrical rhythmic accents and shifting patterns.</p><p></p><p><strong>How does primitivism differ from other musical art forms?</strong></p><p>Its adherents favoured simple, clear-cut tunes of folk character that revolved around a central note and moved within a narrow compass; massive harmonies based on blocklike chords moving in parallel formation with harshly percussive effect; and a strong impulsion to a tonal centre which makes it more unique from other musical art forms.</p><br />
