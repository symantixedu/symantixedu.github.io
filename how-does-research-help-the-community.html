                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>How do humans and other animals communicate with each other?<p></p><p>Animals communicate with each other in many different ways; they use body language, sound, smell, touch and even chemical and electrical communication. ... Apart from learning human words, animals also have their own set of words that they use to talk to each other.</p><p></p>What is the title of the text? _Body language ?<p></p><p>Body language is a type of nonverbal communication in which physical behaviors, as opposed to words, are used to express or convey the information. Such behavior includes facial expressions, body posture, gestures, eye movement, touch and the use of space. </p><p></p>in terms of communication, what are compared in the text?<p></p><p>→ Spoken text is more informal and longer than written text, and uses more words and more sentences. → Spoken sentences also tend to be shorter than those found in essays.</p><p></p>How do humans communicate?<p></p><p>Human beings communicate with incredible detail using language, but we are also probably more detailed visual communicators than other animals. ... Speech and language, vocalisations such as grunts, then a range of other noises can be communicative – lip-smacking, clapping hands, foot-tapping, and so on.</p><p></p>How do animals communicate?<p></p><p>Animals communicate using signals, which can include visual; auditory, or sound-based; chemical, involving pheromones; or tactile, touch-based, cues. Communication behaviors can help animals find mates, establish dominance, defend territory, coordinate group behavior, and care for young.</p><p></p>How do dolphins and whales communicate?<p></p><p>Toothed whales communicate using high-frequency clicks and whistles. Single click sounds are used mainly for echolocation while multiple clicks are used to communicate with other whales and even dolphins in the area. ... Baleen whales use low-frequency sounds, and these can be heard over long distances.</p><p></p>87 What do you think will happen if humans do not communicate with each other?<p></p><p>A lack of communication can ultimately lead to low morale. Because ineffective communication can create misunderstandings, missed opportunities, conflict, the dissemination of misinformation and mistrust, employees might just feel overall defeated.
