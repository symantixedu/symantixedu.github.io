                                            Origins of the English Language1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times.2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the  Saxons, into Great  Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became  the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday).3) Then we must comprehend or understand   how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles   and the Saxons and made them   slaves. The old English   spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words   helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use   the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of   England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended  the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is  pork, but the animal itself  is known as a pig.4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced  all the way  back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”.5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.Question:What transition signal is used in paragraph 3?Select one:a.nextb.startc.in turnd.then​</a>

                                            A long time ago, Mactan was ruled by a powerful queen named Matang Mantaunos. This brave and wise ruler had a grandson named Lapu-Lapu. In time, Lapu-Lapu became the king of the island.    Lapu-Lapu was the ruler of Mactan when Ferdinad Magellan and his men landed on Limasawa on March 16, 1521. Limasawa is an island near Cebu.    Magellan started making friends with the datus of the neighboring island. Many datus became his friends. They agreed to give Magellan gifts and their services. They also agreed to make Magellan’s king their king.But Lapu-Lapu refused to bow to Magellan’s king. He refused to pay taxes to an invader. This angered Magellan. He planned ways to conquer Lapu-lapu.     In a nearby island, there was a ruler who hated Lapu-Lapu. Datu Zula agreed to help Magellan invade Mactan. Rajah Humabon, who was one of Magellan’s first native friends, helped Magellan, too. He led one thousand Cebuanos against Lapu-Lapu’s men. Magellan led sixty Spanish soldiers who wereThe Battle of Mactan began that early morning of April 27,1521. Lapu-Lapu’s men did not wait for the enemy to reach the shore. Before the enemy’s ships had entered the bay, Lapu-Lapu’s men were already positioned behind the rocks and corals. They knew the ships could not push ashore, for the bay was narrow. The enemy would have to get off their ships and wade in.     As Magellan and his men waded ashore, Lapu-Lapu gave the signal to attack. His men quietly moved out from their hiding places and surrounded the enemy. Spears, lances, and arrows rained on the invaders.    Magellan’s men were surprised. They were not yet ready to fight. The cannons on their ships were useless as the ships were too far out in the sea.    Lapu-Lapu and his men charged continuously. Magellan and many of his men fell. The remaining invaders retreated to their boats in fear and sailed away hastily. They left behind the body of Magellan and those of their other companions.    well-armed.     Lapu-Lapu saw the invaders long before they could reach the shore. That midnight, his one thousand five hundred men were already positioned for war. They were armed with spears, arrows, and heavy pestles called alho.  Let's answer these questions1. Who are the characters in the story?

Origins of the English Language
1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times.
2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the  Saxons, into Great  Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became  the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday).
3) Then we must comprehend or understand   how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles   and the Saxons and made them   slaves. The old English   spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words   helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use   the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of   England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended  the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is  pork, but the animal itself  is known as a pig.
4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced  all the way  back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”.
5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.

By that time, ash from the eruption reached Manila, forcing the airport to close and more than 500 flights to be canceled and the danger level was raised to level four, which indicates "a hazardous eruption within hours to days was possible." On Monday, hundreds of thousands of people faced possible evacuations in the area around the Filipino capital as the country's Taal volcano (which is just south of Manila) started to erupt, The Associated Press reported. And experts say this could just be the beginning, adding it's possible people will see yet another "hazardous explosive eruption." So far, more than 30,000 villagers have evacuated, but there have been no reports of casualties or major damage. The airport has been partially reopened. According to The AP, citing the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, the start of activity in the Taal volcano on Sunday was sudden, initially spurting steam, ash and pebbles up to nine miles into the air. This eruption comes just weeks after a volcano erupted on New Zealand's White Island, which killed at least 18 people, many of them tourists.1.

                                            Tales of the Deep: The Giant Squid  Have you ever wondered what swims in the deepest parts of the world's oceans? Well, we just got a better idea about one mysterious creature of the deep ocean: the giant squid.  Just recently a Japanese film crew managed to film a giant squid swimming in its natural habitat. They managed to lure it to their cameras with bait after many hours of waiting and searching two thousand feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean.  The giant squid is truly a giant. It can grow up to 50 feet in length, with tentacles making up most of this great length. For comparison, 50 feet is about as long as most school buses. Imagine meeting something the size of your school bus in the deep dark ocean and you might get an idea what it is like to meet a squid.  Over the centuries, many squid specimens have been found, but it's hard to get an idea of how the squid lives because it typically cruises in the deepest depths of the ocean. We know that the giant squid's main predator is the sperm whale. We know this because bits of giant squid have been found in the stomachs of sperm whales. We also know they feed on deep-sea fish and other squid. We know this because of all the giant squid that have washed ashore.  The giant squid lives in all of the world's oceans—though few are found in the tropics or the Arctic waters. As a result, stories of giant squid were told among sailors for hundreds of years. These sightings must have been frightening and may be the source for the legend of the Kraken—a sea monster reputed to be as large as an island—capable of eating an entire ship. 
 Which sentence most correctly explains the main idea of the last paragraph?   A.  Many sailors lost their lives and boats to giant squid, leaving first-hand accounts in their ships' logs. B. Many sailors saw giant squid in most of the world's oceans, giving rise to the legend of the Kraken. C Many sailors saw sperm whales in the world's oceans, adding to fears that the giant squid was endangered D. Many sailors noted large schools of deep sea fish and feared the giant squid had became endangered</a>

                            5. Origins of the English Language1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times.2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the  Saxons, into Great  Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became  the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday).3) Then we must comprehend or understand   how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles   and the Saxons and made them   slaves. The old English   spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words   helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use   the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of   England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended  the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is  pork, but the animal itself  is known as a pig.4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced  all the way  back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”.5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.Question:What transition signal is used in paragraph 3?Select one:a.nextb.startc.in turnd.then​</h2><br />

                            7. A long time ago, Mactan was ruled by a powerful queen named Matang Mantaunos. This brave and wise ruler had a grandson named Lapu-Lapu. In time, Lapu-Lapu became the king of the island.    Lapu-Lapu was the ruler of Mactan when Ferdinad Magellan and his men landed on Limasawa on March 16, 1521. Limasawa is an island near Cebu.    Magellan started making friends with the datus of the neighboring island. Many datus became his friends. They agreed to give Magellan gifts and their services. They also agreed to make Magellan’s king their king.But Lapu-Lapu refused to bow to Magellan’s king. He refused to pay taxes to an invader. This angered Magellan. He planned ways to conquer Lapu-lapu.     In a nearby island, there was a ruler who hated Lapu-Lapu. Datu Zula agreed to help Magellan invade Mactan. Rajah Humabon, who was one of Magellan’s first native friends, helped Magellan, too. He led one thousand Cebuanos against Lapu-Lapu’s men. Magellan led sixty Spanish soldiers who wereThe Battle of Mactan began that early morning of April 27,1521. Lapu-Lapu’s men did not wait for the enemy to reach the shore. Before the enemy’s ships had entered the bay, Lapu-Lapu’s men were already positioned behind the rocks and corals. They knew the ships could not push ashore, for the bay was narrow. The enemy would have to get off their ships and wade in.     As Magellan and his men waded ashore, Lapu-Lapu gave the signal to attack. His men quietly moved out from their hiding places and surrounded the enemy. Spears, lances, and arrows rained on the invaders.    Magellan’s men were surprised. They were not yet ready to fight. The cannons on their ships were useless as the ships were too far out in the sea.    Lapu-Lapu and his men charged continuously. Magellan and many of his men fell. The remaining invaders retreated to their boats in fear and sailed away hastily. They left behind the body of Magellan and those of their other companions.    well-armed.     Lapu-Lapu saw the invaders long before they could reach the shore. That midnight, his one thousand five hundred men were already positioned for war.

As the Philippines Volcano Started to Erupt - and the Photos Are This Couple Breathtaking BY ALISON FOX JANUARY 13, 2020 As smoke filled the sky and ash spewed out of a volcano in the Philippines and hundreds of flights in and out of Manila were canceled, one couple went through - and captured stunningly beautiful photos in the process. with their outdoor wedding The couple said "I do," on Sunday, 10 miles away from the volcano, according to CNN. By that time, ash from the eruption reached Manila, forcing the airport to close and more than 500 flights to be canceled and the danger level was raised to level four, which indicates "a hazardous eruption within hours to days was possible." On Monday, hundreds of thousands of people faced possible evacuations in the area around the Filipino capital as the country's Taal volcano (which is just south of Manila) started to erupt, The Associated Press reported. And experts say this could just be the beginning, adding it's possible people will see yet another "hazardous explosive eruption." So far, more than 30,000 villagers have evacuated, but there have been no reports of casualties or major damage. The airport has been partially reopened. According to The AP, citing the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, the start of activity in the Taal volcano on Sunday was sudden, initially spurting steam, ash and pebbles up to nine miles into the air. This eruption comes just weeks after a volcano erupted on New Zealand's White Island, which killed at least 18 people, many of them tourists.1.

                            18. Origins of the English Language1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times.2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the  Saxons, into Great  Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became  the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday).3) Then we must comprehend or understand   how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles   and the Saxons and made them   slaves. The old English spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words   helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use   the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of   England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended  the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is  pork, but the animal itself  is known as a pig.4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced  all the way  back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”.5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.Question: Which statement is true based on the definition from the passage?Select one:a.Pig is a French word, meaning a live animal.b.Porcis a French word, meaning the flesh of a pig to be cooked and eaten.c.Conquer comes from the Latin roots, conquarere, meaning to win.d.all of the choices8 ko​</h2><br />

                            20. Tales of the Deep: The Giant Squid  Have you ever wondered what swims in the deepest parts of the world's oceans? Well, we just got a better idea about one mysterious creature of the deep ocean: the giant squid.  Just recently a Japanese film crew managed to film a giant squid swimming in its natural habitat. They managed to lure it to their cameras with bait after many hours of waiting and searching two thousand feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean.  The giant squid is truly a giant. It can grow up to 50 feet in length, with tentacles making up most of this great length. For comparison, 50 feet is about as long as most school buses. Imagine meeting something the size of your school bus in the deep dark ocean and you might get an idea what it is like to meet a squid.  Over the centuries, many squid specimens have been found, but it's hard to get an idea of how the squid lives because it typically cruises in the deepest depths of the ocean. We know that the giant squid's main predator is the sperm whale. We know this because bits of giant squid have been found in the stomachs of sperm whales. We also know they feed on deep-sea fish and other squid. We know this because of all the giant squid that have washed ashore.  The giant squid lives in all of the world's oceans—though few are found in the tropics or the Arctic waters. As a result, stories of giant squid were told among sailors for hundreds of years. These sightings must have been frightening and may be the source for the legend of the Kraken—a sea monster reputed to be as large as an island—capable of eating an entire ship. 
 Which sentence most correctly explains the main idea of the last paragraph?   A.  Many sailors lost their lives and boats to giant squid, leaving first-hand accounts in their ships' logs. B. Many sailors saw giant squid in most of the world's oceans, giving rise to the legend of the Kraken. C Many sailors saw sperm whales in the world's oceans, adding to fears that the giant squid was endangered D. Many sailors noted large schools of deep sea fish and feared the giant squid had became endangered</h2><br />
                        The answer is B, it's B because the last sentence talks about the legend of the Karken, and B's the only one that talks about the Karken. <br />
