                        <p>Answer:</p><p>1. Lita's profit from selling the dresses was P11 014.00.</p><p>2. Milly earns P5 625.00 in 5 weeks.</p><p>3.

The garbage collector earns P3 840.00 for good service in 6 months.</p><p>Step-by-step explanation:</p><p>1. Lita's profit from selling the dresses can be calculated by subtracting the total cost of making the dresses (P7 386.35) from the total sales revenue (P18 900.00). This gives us a profit of P11 014.00.</p><p></p><p>2.

This gives us a total of P5 625.00.</p><p></p><p>3. To calculate how much Jay saved, we need to subtract Adrian's savings from Jay's total savings. This gives us a difference of P300.00, which means that Jay saved P3</p><p></p><p>4. Glen had P960.00 left after buying the roses because he spent a total of P110.00 on notebooks and ballpens, and P75.00 on roses. This left him with a total of P960.00.</p><p></p><p>5. Dominic saves P9 000.00 in 18 weekends because he saves half of his earnings each week. Over the course of 18 weeks, this accumulates to a total of P9 000.00.</p><p></p><p>6. The garbage collector earns P3 840.00 for good service in 6 months because he receives P20.00 from 9 households once a week. This totals up to P3 840.00 over the course of 6 months.</p><br />
