                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction
</p><p>Marie and Pierre Curie‘s pioneering research was again brought to mind when on April 20 1995, their bodies were taken from their place of burial at Sceaux, just outside Paris, and in a solemn ceremony were laid to rest under the mighty dome of the Panthéon. Marie Curie thus became the first woman to be accorded this mark of honour on her own merit. One woman, Sophie Berthelot, admittedly already rested there but in the capacity of wife of the chemist Marcelin Berthelot (1827-1907).
</p><p>
</p><p>It was François Mitterrand who, before ending his fourteen-year-long presidency, took this initiative, as he said “in order to finally respect the equality of women and men before the law and in reality” (“pour respecter enfin …l’égalité des femmes et des hommes dans le droit comme dans les faits”). In point of fact – as the press pointed out – this initiative was symbolic three times over. Marie Curie was a woman, she was an immigrant and she had to a high degree helped increase the prestige of France in the scientific world.
</p><p>
</p><p>At the end of the 19th century, a number of discoveries were made in physics which paved the way for the breakthrough of modern physics and led to the revolutionary technical development that is continually changing our daily lives.
</p><p>
</p><p>Around 1886, Heinrich Hertz demonstrated experimentally the existence of radio waves. It is said that Hertz only smiled incredulously when anyone predicted that his waves would one day be sent round the earth. Hertz died in 1894 at the early age of 37. In September 1895, Guglielmo Marconi sent the first radio signal over a distance of 1.5 km. In 1901 he spanned the Atlantic. Hertz did not live long enough to experience the far-reaching positive effects of his great discovery, nor of course did he have to see it abused in bad television programs. It is hard to predict the consequences of new discoveries in physics.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>1.) A sugar substitute (artificial sweetener) is a food additive that duplicates the effect of sugar in taste, but usually has less food energy. Besides its benefits, animal studies have convincingly proven that artificial sweeteners cause weight gain, brain tumors, bladder cancer and many other health hazards.</p><p>2.) Advantage of cellphone used in schools is we can provide opportunities for multimedia learning and disadvantages of cellphone used in schools is can potentially affect students' mental health due to the impacts on social interaction and the effects of misuse.</p><p>3.) Yes, because for elderly pet owners, who often live alone or in group facilities, pets can help reduce stress, lower blood pressure, increase social interaction and physical activity and help them learn.</p><p>4.) Yes, because in 1900 there were fewer than 2 billion people on the planet; today there are 7.7 billion. </p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This chapter provides an overview and a perspective on the breadth and types of technologies that may have an impact on the life sciences enterprise of the future, with the understanding that there are inherent difficulties in anticipating or predicting how any of these technologies alone or in combination will alter the nature of the future threat “landscape.”</p><p></p><p>Rather than attempt to cover the technology landscape in a comprehensive manner, this chapter (1) highlights technologies likely to have obvious or high-impact near-term consequences; (2) illustrates the general principles by which technological growth alters the nature of future biological threats; and, (3) highlights how and why some technologies are complementary or synergistic in bolstering defense against future threats while also enhancing or altering the nature of future threats.</p><p></p><p>There is immense diversity and rapid evolution of technologies with relevance to (or impact on) the life sciences enterprise. Their impact(s) may be beneficial or detrimental depending on how these tools and technologies are applied. Some may be seen as “coming out of left field”; that is, these technologies may have very different applications from those originally intended, or may be combined in unexpected, nontraditional configurations. The combination of nanotechnology and biotechnology is one such example of a synergistic combination.</p><p></p><p>Many of the technologies discussed in this chapter create novel opportunities for scientists (and others) to explore aspects of biological and chemical diversity that cannot be accessed through natural mechanisms</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>follow me ok </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It could be argued that of all the ways technology has improved the lives of humans across the globe, none are as important as the technological advances in medicine. From the invention of X-ray machines to advances in surgical practices, technology has made us healthier and increased life expectancies[1]. As we move further into the 21st century, we continue to develop technologies that cure illnesses and improve our quality of life. Health informatics is heavily integrated with technology and graduates with a Master of Science in Health Informatics degree can help to push the boundaries of healthcare throughout their careers.</p><p>sana naka help jajbsbskanbss</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.However, artificial sweeteners sometimes have negative effects on the body and brain that sugars do not.

                        <p>Research is an active, diligent, and systematic investigative process with the aim of finding, interpreting, and revising facts. Research has many benefits and <strong>can improve human life,</strong> especially in the field of science. </p><p><strong>There are several benefits of research that can improve the quality of life, such as:</strong></p><p><strong>1. As a source of information</strong></p><p>In a study, we can name a lot of information related to certain things. Information in a study is <strong>reliable information </strong>because it is based on theory and also supporting evidence.</p><p><strong>2. Research answers the problem</strong></p><p>As we know that a reason for research is because there are <strong>unsolved problems.</strong> And by conducting research, the problem will <strong>be resolved</strong> or <strong>answered </strong>and which is certainly <strong>credible </strong>and <strong>trustworthy</strong>.</p><p><strong>3. Research as an effort to discover new things</strong></p><p>With the things being researched, it is determined that there will be new things that are found. Not only that, research can also be <strong>proof </strong>of the truth of existing knowledge and<strong> develop it.</strong></p><p><strong>4. To test or verify a topic or problem</strong></p><p>To test or verify a topic or problem where the results can st<strong>rengthen a particular theory </strong>or view and can also reject the results of that theory or view.</p><p><strong>There are several types of research as follows:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Basic Research</strong></p><p>Basic research is <strong>data collected to increase knowledge</strong>. The main motivation is the expansion of knowledge.</p><p><strong>2. Secondary Research</strong></p><p>Secondary research or desk research is a research method that involves the <strong>use of existing data.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Applied Research</strong></p><p>Applied research focuses on <strong>analyzing and solving real-life problems.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Problem-Oriented Research</strong></p><p>As the name suggests, problem-oriented research is conducted to <strong>understand the true nature of the problem</strong> in order to find relevant solutions. The term "<strong>problem</strong>" refers to several options or problems when analyzing a situation.</p><p><strong>6. Qualitative Research</strong></p><p>Qualitative research is a process of <strong>inquiry</strong>. This helps to create an in-depth understanding of the problem or issue in its natural setting. This type of research is a<strong> non-statistical method</strong>. Qualitative research relies heavily on the <strong>experience of the researcher</strong> and the questions used to <strong>investigate the sample</strong>.</p><p><strong>7. Quantitative Research</strong></p><p>Qualitative research is a structured way of collecting data and analyzing it to draw conclusions. Unlike qualitative methods, this method uses <strong>computational </strong>and s<strong>tatistical processes</strong> to collect and analyze data. Quantitative data is<strong> data in the form of numbers.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about</strong> the importance of research here https://brainly.co.id/tugas/11069794</p><p></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><br />

                        1. Youth-led research, as already described, is so much more than research for the sake of uncovering new knowledge on particular conditions. It has implications for interventions that may be program or community based. The conceptualization of the goals, principles, and outcomes for these types of initiatives is determined by the spon- sor(s) of the research. Once a determination is made for undertaking a youth-led research project, then a process must ensue that addresses the goals, principles, and outcomes of the research project.<br /><br />2.

In attempting to understand how humans can realize their highest potential, I have found it pertinent to take a needs-based perspective. We all have fundamental basic needs, that when severely thwarted, cause us to all act in the same predictable fashion. One of my biggest influences is the humanistic psychologist Abraham Maslow, who often pondered why people could be so cruel. In one unpublished note, he concluded that it’s due to the “insecurity cycle”:<br /><br /><br />Mark it to BRAINLIEST. Hope it helps. <br />
