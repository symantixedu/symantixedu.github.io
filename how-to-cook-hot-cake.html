                        We can use ratio and proportion here. We can express the sentence "In cooking pancakes, 2 eggs are needed for every 1 cup of hot cake mix" as 2 : 1.<br />Now, let x represent the number of cups of hotcake mix if the baker uses 7 eggs.<br />2 : 1 = 7 : x<br />(2)(x) = (7)(1)<br />2x = 7<br />2x/2 = 7/2<br />x = 7/2<br />x = 3 and 1/2<br />Therefore, the cups of hotcake mix that is made if the baker uses 7 eggs is 3 and 1/2.<br />:)<br />

                        <p>a. The operation to be used is subtraction.</p><p></p><p>b. The number sentence would be "15/20 - x = 1 cup", where x is the number of cups of flour that Luz needs.</p><p></p><p>c. To find the solution, we can use the fact that one cup is equal to 20/20 of a cup. This means that we can multiply both sides of the equation by 20/20 to get "15/20 * 20/20 - x * 20/20 = 1 * 20/20". This simplifies to "15 - x = 20", and then we can subtract 15 from both sides of the equation to get "0 - x = 5". Finally, we can add x to both sides of the equation to get "x = 5".</p><p></p><p>d. The complete answer is that Luz needs 5 more cups of flour.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>a. The operation to be used is subtraction.</p><p>b. The number sentence is 15/20 - x = 1 cup.</p><p>c. To solve, we need to find the value of x that will make the equation true. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 20/15 to get rid of the fraction. This gives us 20/15 x = 1 cup * 20/15 = 4/3 cup. Then we subtract 4/3 cup from both sides to get 0 = 4/3 cup - x, and we can see that x = 4/3 cup.</p><p>d. The answer is 4/3 cup. This means that Luz needs 4/3 cup more flour to make a cup of hot cake.</p><br />
