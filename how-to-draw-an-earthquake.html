What is the approximate distance to the epicenter if the difference in the arrival times of the P waveand S wave is 5.5 min?5. As the distance to the epicenter increases, how does the amount of time between the S wave andthe P wave change?6. After drawing the first circle for Balboa Heights, where is the earthquake epicenter located relative to thisone circle?7. After drawing the circle for Boulder, you now have two circles on your map. Relative to these two circles,where is the earthquake epicenter?8. After drawing the circle for Mexico City, you now have three circles on your map. Relative to the threecircles, where is the earthquake epicenter?9. Give the location and year of the major earthquake from the past that occurred in the same area as theepicenter you have just located? (A textbook will help you answer this question.)10. Would it be possible for an earthquake at this same location to be felt where you live?Why or why not?​</a>

I am confident that you can do this review task without any problem. Directions: Analyze each statement below. Draw a smiley face if the statement is TRUE and sad face if the statement is FALSE. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. 1. An earthquake is a vibration of the earth due to rapid release of energy. 2. Rocks along the fault move immediately because it has no friction that keeps them in place. 3. A fault is a break in the Earth's crust where significant movement has taken place. 4. When a fault suddenly moves, the energy released from inside the Earth causes the ground to move. 5. All movements along faults produce earthquake. ​</a>

Records reveal that earthquakes have destroyed valuable properties.2. When energy is released from the moving crustal plates, the surrounding rockslaver trembles and shifts.3. Pressure from above and beneath the crust causes the plates to move.4. It occurs when there is a sudden displacement of rocks or rock materials belowthe crust.5. When magma moves along a fissure, they cause the Earth's crust to trembleor shake, too.6. The shifting or moving of crustal plates have given rise to tectonic earthquakes7. Felt by small number of persons at rest.8. Intense heat from the earth's interior affects the crustal plates.9. Volcanic earthquakes are induced by rising lava or magma beneath activevolcanoes.10.

The seismograph produces a digital graphic recording of the ground motion caused by the seismic waves. The digital recording is called a seismogram.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Triangulation method is a method to identify the epicenter of an earthquake. in order to do this, each of at least 3 seismic stations must determine the distance from their respective station to the epicenter of the quake. then after that, each of them must draw a circle and their respective radius is the distance from their station to the epicenter. after drawing circles, the intersection point of the circles must be determined to identify the epicenter of an earthquake.</p><p></p><p>A. satisifies this explanation</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Observations: When the two books were slowly pushed towards each other, the toy structures on top of them stuck together. The toy structures did not move independently, but instead, they moved together as if they were attached to each other.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Results: The result of the activity showed that when two objects are pushed towards each other with enough force, they stick together and move as one.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Answers to the Questions:</strong></p><p><strong>1. When the two books were pushed towards each other, the toy structures on top of them stuck together and moved as one.</strong></p><p><strong>2. Based on the observations made in the activity, it can be related to real-life situations such as earthquakes where tectonic plates move and collide with each other resulting in earthquakes. Just like the toy structures, when tectonic plates move, they stick together and move as one, causing seismic waves that can result in calamities such as landslides, tsunamis, and building collapses.</strong></p><p><strong>3. In case of an earthquake, it is important to have an emergency plan and preparedness kit, which may include food, water, first aid kit, flashlights, and extra batteries. It is also essential to have a designated meeting place in case of separation, and to keep important documents in a secure and accessible location. It is equally important to stay informed about earthquake preparedness and to practice earthquake drills regularly to be properly trained in responding to such emergencies.<br /><br />I hope this helps!</strong></p><p></p><br />

During the earthquake animals can be very badly hurt or injured some loose their lives.</p><p>3.Most earthquake-induced building damage, however, is a result of ground shaking. When the ground shakes at a building site, the building's foundations vibrate in a manner that's similar to the surrounding ground.

Directions: Analyze each statement below. Draw a smiley face if the statement is TRUE and sad face if the statement is FALSE. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. 1. An earthquake is a vibration of the earth due to rapid release of energy. 2. Rocks along the fault move immediately because it has no friction that keeps them in place. 3. A fault is a break in the Earth's crust where significant movement has taken place. 4. When a fault suddenly moves, the energy released from inside the Earth causes the ground to move. 5. All movements along faults produce earthquake. ​</h2><br />

Pressure from above and beneath the crust causes the plates to move.4. It occurs when there is a sudden displacement of rocks or rock materials belowthe crust.5. When magma moves along a fissure, they cause the Earth's crust to trembleor shake, too.6. The shifting or moving of crustal plates have given rise to tectonic earthquakes7.
