                                            ANSWER PLSSS ASAP Text A I firmly believe that there is a colony of goblins living inside the moon, and the government is keeping this information from you. How do we know this ? Look at the moon! See that little squiggle? You were taught that was just a crater, but it isn't. It is actually actually the tip of an enermous goblin moon base. How do I know that? the goblins told me so. I have special phone line from my house to the moon- goblins, and through me, they can answer any question you've got. Our moon-door is always open, the goblins tell me. Text B Earth has just one moon - a rocky, cratered place, roughly a quarter the size of Earth and an average of 238,855 miles away. The Moon can be seen with the naked eye most nights as it traces its 27-day orbit around our planet. Chances are that when you imagine the night sky, one of the first things that comes to mind is the Moon "glowing" in the darkness. The Moon has always held a special place in our imaginations and in daily life. It's no wonder that we are fascinated. The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and one that we can easily see most nights. What makes the Moon glow? The Moon does not shine with its own light. It simply reflects light coming shape each night from the Sun. Why does it look like the Moon is changing shape? From Earth, it might look like the Moon is our spot on Earth, we see - from a tiny sliver to a half moon to a full moon and back again. What's actually happening is that from different parts of the Moon lit up by the Sun as the Moon travels in its orbit. Is there actually a "dark side" of the Moon? No. The Moon rotates on its own axis at the same rate that it orbits around Earth. That means we always see the same side of the Moon from our position on Earth. The side we don't see gets just as much light, so a more accurate name for that part of the Moon is the "far side. "Even thousands of years ago, humans drew pictures to track the changes of the Moon. Later, people used their observations of the Moon to create calendars. Today, we study the Moon using telescopes and spacecraft. For example, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has been circling the Moon and sending back measurements since 2009. The Moon is the only other planetary body that humans have visited. On July 20, 1969, NASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first people to set foot on the dusty surface of the Moon. Ten other American astronauts followed. They collected hundreds of pounds of lunar soil and rock samples, conducted experiments and installed equipment for follow-up measurements. Using a Venn Diagram compare the two text. Refer to the comprehensive questions below as your guide in writing the content of your diagram. 1. What are the difference between two passages? 2. What are the similarities of the two passages? 3.

                            20. ANSWER PLSSS ASAP Text A I firmly believe that there is a colony of goblins living inside the moon, and the government is keeping this information from you. How do we know this ? Look at the moon! See that little squiggle? You were taught that was just a crater, but it isn't. It is actually actually the tip of an enermous goblin moon base. How do I know that? the goblins told me so. I have special phone line from my house to the moon- goblins, and through me, they can answer any question you've got. Our moon-door is always open, the goblins tell me. Text B Earth has just one moon - a rocky, cratered place, roughly a quarter the size of Earth and an average of 238,855 miles away. The Moon can be seen with the naked eye most nights as it traces its 27-day orbit around our planet. Chances are that when you imagine the night sky, one of the first things that comes to mind is the Moon "glowing" in the darkness. The Moon has always held a special place in our imaginations and in daily life. It's no wonder that we are fascinated. The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and one that we can easily see most nights. What makes the Moon glow? The Moon does not shine with its own light. It simply reflects light coming shape each night from the Sun. Why does it look like the Moon is changing shape? From Earth, it might look like the Moon is our spot on Earth, we see - from a tiny sliver to a half moon to a full moon and back again. What's actually happening is that from different parts of the Moon lit up by the Sun as the Moon travels in its orbit. Is there actually a "dark side" of the Moon? No. The Moon rotates on its own axis at the same rate that it orbits around Earth. That means we always see the same side of the Moon from our position on Earth. The side we don't see gets just as much light, so a more accurate name for that part of the Moon is the "far side. "Even thousands of years ago, humans drew pictures to track the changes of the Moon. Later, people used their observations of the Moon to create calendars. Today, we study the Moon using telescopes and spacecraft. For example, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has been circling the Moon and sending back measurements since 2009. The Moon is the only other planetary body that humans have visited. On July 20, 1969, NASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first people to set foot on the dusty surface of the Moon. Ten other American astronauts followed. They collected hundreds of pounds of lunar soil and rock samples, conducted experiments and installed equipment for follow-up measurements. Using a Venn Diagram compare the two text. Refer to the comprehensive questions below as your guide in writing the content of your diagram. 1. What are the difference between two passages? 2. What are the similarities of the two passages? 3.

The first passage discusses the belief in a colony of goblins living inside the moon, while the second passage provides factual information about the moon such as its size, distance from Earth, and the way it reflects light from the sun. The first passage is also more imaginative and unrealistic compared to the second passage. </p><p>2. Both passages talk about the moon and its significance in human history. They both also explain how the moon appears to change shape from Earth and clarify that the moon does not shine with its own light. </p><p>3. The author of the first passage has a belief in a colony of goblins living inside the moon, and they claim that the government is hiding this information. The author of the second passage presents factual information and does not express any belief or point of view.</p><p>4. The first author provides no evidence for their claim, aside from saying that the goblins have told them so through a special phone line. The second author provides evidence such as the Moon's size, distance from Earth, the way it reflects light, and information on human exploration of the Moon, including the lunar missions conducted by NASA.</p><p></p><p>Consider</p><p><strong>•Brainliest - Choose this answer as the best answer if you think it is the most helpful and informative.</strong></p><p></p><p>•Upvote/like - Show appreciation for the answer by clicking the upvote or like button.</p><p></p><p>•Comment/critique - Give constructive feedback on the answer, pointing out what is correct and what can be improved.</p><p></p><p>•Rate - Rate the answer on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how helpful it was.</p><p></p><p><strong>•Follow - Click the "Follow" button to stay updated on future answers and posts by the author.</strong></p><p></p><p>#Lazy learning to the rescue</p><p>#God bless</p><p>#Learning fast and easy</p><p>#Accurate answer</p><p>#Chillax</p><p></p><p></p><br />

You are a hygiene specialist. Your company requires you to conduct a survey
regarding the use of these three products (shampoo, conditioner, soap) an individual usually use as part of their daily personal hygiene in taking a bath. Your goal is to make a survey report regarding the use of these products with a total of 30 respondents. Your report must contain the raw data coming from your respondents. (Name of the respondent is optional. You may use name such as Respondent A or Respondent 1 and so on.) As part of the report’s summary, make a Venn diagram showing the result of your survey. This report must also show your solutions (operations on set) and answers to the following questions below:
1. How many prefer using shampoo only?
2. How many prefer using conditioner only?
3. How many prefer using soap only?
4. How many prefer using shampoo and conditioner?
5. How many prefer using shampoo and soap?
6. How many prefer using conditioner and soap?
