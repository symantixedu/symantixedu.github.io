                        <p>1. Poem redirects to poetry.  It is a collection of spoken or written words that expresses ideas or emotions in a powerfully vivid and imaginative style.</p><p>2. Yes, before we don't have technologies and lack of transportation to help us in every day but now we have high-tech appliances and transportation that will help us in our daily needs. </p><p>3. I can say that the pandemic help us to be more careful about our surroundings and also ourselves. It thought us how to act as one and appreciate efforts to each other. </p><p>4. I can say that it's not that easy to live in new normal. For example in education, it's hard to learn through online and in answering modules. It has a lot of hindrances not just to teachers but also to learners. Students are not motivated in learning, not all parents has the capacity to teach their child. </p><p></p><br />
