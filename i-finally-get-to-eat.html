                                            The Crow and the Sparrow
Once upon a time, a sparrow made friends with a crow. One day, they
were hunting for food, the crow spied some red peppers that were spread out
on a mat to dry. “Look at those peppers”, said crow to the sparrow. “Let’s see
who can eat the most, and if I am going to win, I’m going to eat you”, the
sparrow laughed and agreed for the thought that the crow was joking. The
sparrow ate each pepper fairly, but the crow cheated.
“I’ve won! Now I’m going to eat you!” Then at last, the sparrow realized
that the crow was serious. “all right,”, he said. “I’ll keep my promise but before
you eat me, you must wash your beak, for everyone knows that you are a dirty
bird and eat a lot of nasty things.”
So, the crow went to the river and asked water to wash his beak, the
river agreed but the crow must get a pot to put it in. Then, the crow went to
the village to get a pot but the potter told the crow to look for clay to make a
pot. The crow went to the field and began digging up clay with his beak, but
the earth refused unless the crow will use a spade. The crow went to the village
blacksmith and asked to make him a spade, but the blacksmith replied if he
wants a spade, he must bring the blacksmith a fire.
Finally, the crow went to the farmer’s house. The farmer’s wife was
cooking rice in the country yard and the crow asked her to give him a fire,
and the farmer’s wife put the fire on the crow’s back and his feathers burnt
into flame

No matter how hard he tried, the fox could not find food. Finally he went to the edge of the forest and searched there for food. Suddenly he caught sight of a big tree with a hole in it.</p><p></p><p>Inside the hole was a package. The hungry fox immediately thought that there might be food in it, and he became very happy. He jumped into the hole and when he opened the package, he saw there were a lot of food, bread, meat and fruit in it!</p><p></p><p>An old woodcutter had placed the food in the tree trunk while he cut down trees in the forest. He was going to eat it for his lunch.</p><p></p><p>The fox happily began to eat. After the fox had finished eating, he felt thirsty and decided to leave the trunk and drink some water from a nearby spring. However, no matter how hard he tried, he could not get out of the hole. Do you know why? Yes, the fox had eaten so much food that he became too big to fit through the hole.The fox was very sad and upset. He told himself, “I wish that I had thought a little before jumping into the hole.”</p><p></p><p>Yes children, this is the result of doing something without thinking about it first.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope its help</p><p></p><br />

                            28. The Crow and the Sparrow
Once upon a time, a sparrow made friends with a crow. One day, they
were hunting for food, the crow spied some red peppers that were spread out
on a mat to dry. “Look at those peppers”, said crow to the sparrow. “Let’s see
who can eat the most, and if I am going to win, I’m going to eat you”, the
sparrow laughed and agreed for the thought that the crow was joking. The
sparrow ate each pepper fairly, but the crow cheated.
“I’ve won! Now I’m going to eat you!” Then at last, the sparrow realized
that the crow was serious. “all right,”, he said. “I’ll keep my promise but before
you eat me, you must wash your beak, for everyone knows that you are a dirty
bird and eat a lot of nasty things.”
So, the crow went to the river and asked water to wash his beak, the
river agreed but the crow must get a pot to put it in. Then, the crow went to
the village to get a pot but the potter told the crow to look for clay to make a
pot. The crow went to the field and began digging up clay with his beak, but
the earth refused unless the crow will use a spade. The crow went to the village
blacksmith and asked to make him a spade, but the blacksmith replied if he
wants a spade, he must bring the blacksmith a fire.
Finally, the crow went to the farmer’s house. The farmer’s wife was
cooking rice in the country yard and the crow asked her to give him a fire,
and the farmer’s wife put the fire on the crow’s back and his feathers burnt
into flame
