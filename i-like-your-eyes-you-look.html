                                            You are the sun that rose again in my life
The return of my childhood dreams
I don't know what this feeling is
Perhaps I'm also in a dream
Dream is a blue mirage in desert
A priori from deep inside of me
I get breathtakingly euphoric
My surroundings become more and more transparent
I hear the ocean from far away
I walk across the dream over the forest
And go towards there as it gets clearer
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria
Euphoria
Euphoria
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria
Close the door now
When I'm with you I'm in utopia
Euphoria
Euphoria
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria
Euphoria
Euphoria
Close the door now
When I'm with you I'm in utopia
Did you wander looking for a dream erased like rainbow
It's different from a plain word like fate
You're looking at the same place with me with a pain in your eyes
Won't you please stay in dreams</a>

                                            The young man bowed low as the king entered the room. When he raised his eyes, he gasped in astonishment as he noticed that the king looked very similar to the begger, he met on the way. The king saw the shock in the man's eye and said," Yes, I was the beggar you met on your way." "But...bu...bu... why did you dress up like a beggar. You are king. Well, then, why did you do this to me?" the young man stammered after gaining some composure. "Because I had to be sure that you had a good heart and genuinely love your fellow human beings," said the king. "I knew that if I came to you asking, you would have done anything to impress me. But that way I would never have known what is truly in your heart. So I used a ruse. Beggar had nothing to offer you. The generosity and love to the one in need without expecting anything in return is the sign of a great heart. Looking at your love and generosity towards the beggar proved that you sincerely love your fellow human beings. This country needs a leader who would work for the welfare of all of the nation, not just ones who would offer and cater to the throne. You have proved that you are the right person to be my successor," promised the king.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I expressed myself by doing things I want the most.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The figurative language used in the lyrics is:</p><p></p><p>Simile: "I'm in a field of dandelions, wishing on every one that you'll be mine, mine." - This is a simile because it uses the word "like" to compare being in a field of dandelions to the act of wishing on every one of them, implying that the person's desire for the other person is as abundant as the dandelions in the field.</p><p></p><p>Hyperbole: "And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime, and I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine." - This is a hyperbole because it exaggerates the rarity of finding true love by saying it only comes once in a lifetime, implying that the person believes the other person is their one true love.</p><p></p><p>Metaphor: "Dandelion, into the wind you go, won't you let my darling know?" - This is a metaphor because it compares a dandelion being blown by the wind to the act of conveying a message to the person's "darling." It implies that the person is hoping the message reaches their loved one just like a dandelion disperses its seeds through the wind.</p><p></p><p>Personification: "I see forever in your eyes" - This is personification because it gives human qualities, such as seeing forever, to the eyes of the person the lyrics are addressed to. It implies a deep emotional connection and suggests that the person's eyes hold a sense of eternity.</p><p></p><p>Hyperbole: "I've never felt so alive and free, when you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy." - This is a hyperbole because it exaggerates the intensity of the person's feelings when the other person is looking at them. It implies that their happiness and sense of freedom are greatly amplified in the presence of the other person.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Glad to help ^^ </p><p>pa brainly if you don't mind </p><p></p><br />

The return of my childhood dreams
I don't know what this feeling is
Perhaps I'm also in a dream
Dream is a blue mirage in desert
A priori from deep inside of me
I get breathtakingly euphoric
My surroundings become more and more transparent
I hear the ocean from far away
I walk across the dream over the forest
And go towards there as it gets clearer
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria
Euphoria
Euphoria
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria
Close the door now
When I'm with you I'm in utopia
Euphoria
Euphoria
Take my hands now
You are the cause of my euphoria
Euphoria
Euphoria
Close the door now
When I'm with you I'm in utopia
Did you wander looking for a dream erased like rainbow
It's different from a plain word like fate
You're looking at the same place with me with a pain in your eyes
Won't you please stay in dreams</h2><br />

                            25. The young man bowed low as the king entered the room. When he raised his eyes, he gasped in astonishment as he noticed that the king looked very similar to the begger, he met on the way. The king saw the shock in the man's eye and said," Yes, I was the beggar you met on your way." "But...bu...bu... why did you dress up like a beggar. You are king. Well, then, why did you do this to me?" the young man stammered after gaining some composure. "Because I had to be sure that you had a good heart and genuinely love your fellow human beings," said the king. "I knew that if I came to you asking, you would have done anything to impress me. But that way I would never have known what is truly in your heart. So I used a ruse. Beggar had nothing to offer you. The generosity and love to the one in need without expecting anything in return is the sign of a great heart. Looking at your love and generosity towards the beggar proved that you sincerely love your fellow human beings. This country needs a leader who would work for the welfare of all of the nation, not just ones who would offer and cater to the throne. You have proved that you are the right person to be my successor," promised the king.
