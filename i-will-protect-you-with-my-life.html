agree and why by completing the statements that follow.
PERSON A: I enjoy smoking. It gives me great pleasure and helps me deal with my
everyday stress. There may be health risks involved, but even so it's my choice to
disregard them for the time being. I'm an adult, I pay for my cigarettes myself, and
smoking them is entirely legal. So, as long as I take reasonable steps not to bother
others, I should be able to smoke anywhere and anytime I want.
                                     PERSON B: If someone wishes to smoke, or do anything else for that matter, in
an entirely private setting, where his actions cannot affect anyone else all, he
may do so of course. But we don't live our lives in a vacuum. Whatever he does
publicly is no longer a private affair. In addition to the nuisance brought about by
the smoke and smell. It is also well-known that second-hand smoke is even more
dangerous than first-hand smoke., so non-smokers are affected even more
than smokers! So I have the right to protect myself from a smoker's threat to my
life.
                                                           I agree with Person

1. “There is no love greater than a parents love.” My parents are amazing parents. Without them I would not be the strong and healthy young men I am today. My parents deserve to be happy, in order for that to happen, they want to see me succeed in life, be happy, and live life to the fullest. I owe my parents a lot, because they are the ones who welcome me in this world. And without them I wouldn’t gain the knowledge that I have today. So in return, when I succeed in life, I would make them the happiest parents in the world. I thank them for never giving up on me, although sometimes I am very stubborn.
2. The relationship between the parents and their children is special. Though parents may seem to be harsh, just because they want the best for them. They want their children to grow up disciplined and strong. Parents are the first people who deserve your attention. Through all the years they put efforts to protect you from troubles. We all know our parents will always by our side when we get in trouble or lose everything. They are the ones who pay for your college tuition, your food, and a place to stay. They will help as much as they can.</a>

1. The footsteps were coming closer. I knew I had to get out of there fast. Looking desperately around, I finally spotted a small window at the end of the room, a beacon of light in the dark, rancid basement. I sprinted and leapt up to grab a ceiling pipe.

                                            The following is a true story. No names have been changed to protect anyone, as some are still bitter... Way back in my undergraduate days, I was dating a young woman who was becoming an increasingly important part of my life. Things were definitely moving to something beyond being 'boyfriend and girlfriend" - things were getting 'serious'. We were no longer talking about what to do this weekend, but what we might do next year... or after we graduate. You get the picture. So one day I decided to prepare a romantic dinner for the two of us. As a poor undergraduate student struggling to get by, my idea of a home-cooked meal didn't go much further than what can be accomplished with about eight dollars, two pots, and one microwave oven So for this particular and rather momentous moment, I chose to cook up and serve spaghetti and salad. The table was set. The candles were burning. Adult contemporary alternative music played on a revolutionary audio device called a "CD Player". The salad had been finished. It was time for the main course. I piled spaghetti noodles on my girlfriend's plate and began to ladle Prego sauce over her noodles hot out of the pot. As the sauce poured out of the ladle, a large, cooked cockroach accompanied the sauce onto my girlfriend's plate. Without going into details, there was simply NO WAY that​</a>

agree and why by completing the statements that follow.
PERSON A: I enjoy smoking. It gives me great pleasure and helps me deal with my
everyday stress. There may be health risks involved, but even so it's my choice to
disregard them for the time being. I'm an adult, I pay for my cigarettes myself, and
smoking them is entirely legal. So, as long as I take reasonable steps not to bother
others, I should be able to smoke anywhere and anytime I want.
                                     PERSON B: If someone wishes to smoke, or do anything else for that matter, in
an entirely private setting, where his actions cannot affect anyone else all, he
may do so of course. But we don't live our lives in a vacuum. Whatever he does
publicly is no longer a private affair. In addition to the nuisance brought about by
the smoke and smell. It is also well-known that second-hand smoke is even more
dangerous than first-hand smoke., so non-smokers are affected even more
than smokers! So I have the right to protect myself from a smoker's threat to my
life.
                                                           I agree with Person

                            14. Summarize
1. “There is no love greater than a parents love.” My parents are amazing parents. Without them I would not be the strong and healthy young men I am today. My parents deserve to be happy, in order for that to happen, they want to see me succeed in life, be happy, and live life to the fullest. I owe my parents a lot, because they are the ones who welcome me in this world. And without them I wouldn’t gain the knowledge that I have today. So in return, when I succeed in life, I would make them the happiest parents in the world. I thank them for never giving up on me, although sometimes I am very stubborn.
2. The relationship between the parents and their children is special. Though parents may seem to be harsh, just because they want the best for them. They want their children to grow up disciplined and strong. Parents are the first people who deserve your attention. Through all the years they put efforts to protect you from troubles. We all know our parents will always by our side when we get in trouble or lose everything. They are the ones who pay for your college tuition, your food, and a place to stay. They will help as much as they can.</h2><br />

Things were definitely moving to something beyond being 'boyfriend and girlfriend" - things were getting 'serious'. We were no longer talking about what to do this weekend, but what we might do next year... or after we graduate. You get the picture.

It was time for the main course. I piled spaghetti noodles on my girlfriend's plate and began to ladle Prego sauce over her noodles hot out of the pot.
