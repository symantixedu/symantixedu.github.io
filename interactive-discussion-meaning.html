                                            From Missing Their Peers to Lack of Class Discussions, Students BareFactors Causing Them StressBy Courtney Louise Castro Monday, November 30, 2020Blended learning poses many challenges to students, thus the need to makethem aware of their stressors events or conditions in surroundings thatmay trigger stress and how to deal with themPsychologist and educator Joanne Javier says distance learning can causehigher levels of stress.Javier has some suggestions on how to deal with students' stress because ofblended learning.First, identify the stressors. Is it the workload? Is it the lack ofcommunication with peers? Is it the lack of rest? Recognize the triggers ofstress, before dealing with them.Second, find ways that work to address the stressors. These ways areconsidered as self-care initiatives. If the stressor, for instance, is lack ofinteraction, keep constant communication with peers.Third, practice studying methods such as the Pomodoro technique.This means that for every 25 minutes of work, there should be a break offive minutes. For the fourth repetition of the 25-minute work, a 15- to 20-minute break must be dedicated. This way, students are able to regain theirthought processes, achieve more, and stay consistent.If some stressors are almost impossible to deal with, Javier recommendsseeking help. It is inevitable for students to experience stress, given the newsetup, so they must learn how to deal with the stressors in healthy ways.Excerpt from From Missing Their Peers To Lack of Class Discussions, Students Bare Factors Causing Them Stressaccessed from One news.ph this is srticeo​</a>

Why do you think communication is important?___________________________________________________________________________3. What makes communication effective?___________________________________________________________________________4. What would our life and world be without communication?___________________________________________________________________________LESSON:DEFINITION OF COMMUNICATIONA. Etymological meaning of communicationThe English term 'Communication' has been evolved from Latin language. 'Communis and communicare' are two Latin words related to the word communication. Communis is noun word, which means common, communiality or sharing. Similarly, communicare is a verb, which means 'make something common'. Some scholars relate the term communication with an English word community. Community members have something common to each other. communities are {supposed to be} formed with the tie of communication. It is the foundation of community. Hence, where there is no communication, there can't be a community (Nepali 2011).B. Other meanings of communicationCommunication is a process of sharing and conveying messages or information from one person to another within and across channels, contexts, media, and cultures (McCornack, 2014).There is a wide variety of contexts and situations in which communication can be manifested; it can be a face-to-face interaction, a phone conversation, a group discussion, a meeting or interview, a letter correspondence, a class recitation, and many others (Sepacio and Balgos 2016).Elements of CommunicationCommunication is divided into elements which help us better understand its mechanics or process. These elements are the following:1. Speaker – the source or communicator or sender of information or message. The communicator initiates the process by having a thought or an idea that she/he wishes to transmit to others. 2. Message – the information, ideas, or thoughts conveyed by the speaker in words (whether written or spoken) or in actions (gestures or symbols) 3. Encoding – the process of converting the message into words, actions, or other forms ​</a>

                            5.

                            12. From Missing Their Peers to Lack of Class Discussions, Students BareFactors Causing Them StressBy Courtney Louise Castro Monday, November 30, 2020Blended learning poses many challenges to students, thus the need to makethem aware of their stressors events or conditions in surroundings thatmay trigger stress and how to deal with themPsychologist and educator Joanne Javier says distance learning can causehigher levels of stress.Javier has some suggestions on how to deal with students' stress because ofblended learning.First, identify the stressors. Is it the workload? Is it the lack ofcommunication with peers? Is it the lack of rest? Recognize the triggers ofstress, before dealing with them.Second, find ways that work to address the stressors. These ways areconsidered as self-care initiatives. If the stressor, for instance, is lack ofinteraction, keep constant communication with peers.Third, practice studying methods such as the Pomodoro technique.This means that for every 25 minutes of work, there should be a break offive minutes. For the fourth repetition of the 25-minute work, a 15- to 20-minute break must be dedicated. This way, students are able to regain theirthought processes, achieve more, and stay consistent.If some stressors are almost impossible to deal with, Javier recommendsseeking help. It is inevitable for students to experience stress, given the newsetup, so they must learn how to deal with the stressors in healthy ways.Excerpt from From Missing Their Peers To Lack of Class Discussions, Students Bare Factors Causing Them Stressaccessed from One news.ph this is srticeo​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>From the given dialogue, it can be inferred that the speakers have a familial relationship. The effect of the familial relationship on language form is manifested in the use of informal language, such as the use of terms like “Ma” and “Papa”, as well as the use of the Tagalog term “anak”. The duration of interaction is lengthy, as the dialogue is composed of multiple exchanges between the speakers. The relationship of speaker-audience is interactive in nature, as both parties actively exchange ideas. The role and responsibilities of the speaker is to express their opinion and ideas, as well as to provide feedback to the other speakers. The message communicated is that the speaker is interested in pursuing business management at college, and the delivery is done in a respectful and humorous manner. When the speakers shifted in speech context, the tone shifted from a serious one to a more lighthearted one. The shift in speech style was from a formal one to an informal one. The shift in speech act was from a directive one to a humorous one. The shift in communicative strategy was from a confrontational one to a collaborative one.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>In this dialogue, the speakers have a familial relationship. The effect of this relationship on language form can be seen in the use of familiar terms and pronouns, such as "Ma," "Papa," and "anak," which are used to address family members in Filipino. This also affects the duration of interaction, as familial relationships tend to involve longer and more frequent interactions compared to other types of relationships.</p><p></p><p>The relationship between the speaker and audience in this dialogue is that of parent and child, with the parents serving as the audience and the child speaking to them. This affects the role and responsibilities of the speaker, as the child is expected to show respect and obedience to their parents.</p><p></p><p>The message in this dialogue revolves around the child's desire to pursue a college degree in business management, and the parents' disagreement with this decision due to financial concerns. The delivery of this message is affected by the shift in speech context, as the conversation moves from a casual conversation to a more serious discussion about the child's education and future. This can also be seen in the shift in speech style, from a casual and joking tone to a more respectful and serious tone.</p><p></p><p>The shift in communicative strategy can also be seen in the child's use of the term "multiply" in response to their parents' questioning of their statement.

Communis is noun word, which means common, communiality or sharing. Similarly, communicare is a verb, which means 'make something common'. Some scholars relate the term communication with an English word community. Community members have something common to each other. communities are {supposed to be} formed with the tie of communication. It is the foundation of community. Hence, where there is no communication, there can't be a community (Nepali 2011).B.

These elements are the following:1. Speaker – the source or communicator or sender of information or message. The communicator initiates the process by having a thought or an idea that she/he wishes to transmit to others. 2. Message – the information, ideas, or thoughts conveyed by the speaker in words (whether written or spoken) or in actions (gestures or symbols) 3. Encoding – the process of converting the message into words, actions, or other forms ​</h2><br />
