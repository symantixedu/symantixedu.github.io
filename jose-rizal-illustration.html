                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Monkey and the Tortoise is a story about how being clever can win against deceptive tricks. In Philippine literature and folk tradition, the monkey is always seen as a cunning, deceptive, and exploitative character, whereas the tortoise is the clever and sure-footed one. The story begins when the monkey and turtle decided to plant a banana tree, which they cut in half. Of course, as he is exploitative, the monkey chose the top part where there were fruits growing already. It soon withered and the bottom part that the tortoise planted flourished, but he could not reach the fruits. So the monkey tricked him about harvesting the fruit, which ate all of it. The angry tortoise plotted a revenge that harmed the monkey. The monkey then made him choose, to be pounded with mortar or to be thrown in the river. Since the tortoise is clever, he tricked the monkey into throwing him into the river. In the end, he swam away and arrived. The clever one outwits the deceptive one.</p><p><strong></strong></p><br />
