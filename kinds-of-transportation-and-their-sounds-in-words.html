2.
Recently, scientists have gained an
understanding of a crocodile's
reproductive activity. Crocodiles mate
in the water, where the buoyancy
keeps them from crushing each other.
Prior to mating, there are stylized
postures, jumping, submerged bubble
blowing, and snout contact. After
mating, hard-shelled eggs are laid in a
nest, in a hole scooped in the sand.
When it is time to hatch, the infant
crocodiles begin a loud chirping sound
that leads the female to the nest,
which she excavates. Finally, when all
the babies are accounted for the
mother crocodile, transports them to
the shallow water where they will
remain under adult protection for
weeks or months.

2 Recently, scientists have gained an understanding of a crocodile's reproductive activity. Crocodiles mate in the water, where the buoyancy keeps them from crushing each other. Prior to mating, there are stylized postures, jumping, submerged bubble blowing, and snout contact. After mating, hard-shelled eggs are laid in a nest, in a hole scooped in the sand. When it is time to hatch, the infant crocodiles begin a loud chirping sound that leads the female to the nest, which she excavates. Finally, when all the babies are accounted for, the mother crocodile, transports them to the shallow water where they will remain under adult protection for weeks or months.
3. On the river banks of the Nile River, home to some crocodiles, there are many kinds of birds, sometimes called crocodile birds because they are always hopping around crocodiles. The big crocodiles and the birds are useful to each other for several reasons. The birds eat flies and leeches that they find on the crocodiles' skin and mouths. In this way, the birds get a good meal and the crododiles get rid of the leeches and flies Sometimes an enemy frightens the birds who scream and fly away. As a result of the noise, the birds give the crocodiles a warning of danger.

4. In most parts of the world there are not as many crocodiles as there used to be. This is a problem because crocodiles are becoming endangered and also crocodiles are necessary to the balance of nature. Many crocodiles have died because people dried up the swamps and marshes where the crocodiles live. Poachers have also contributed to the dilemma as crocodiles have been desired for their strong, smooth, leathery skins. In order to preserve these mighty creatures, people must take care of crocodiles' environment and help put a stop to the needless shooting of these animals.
5. Alligators and crocodiles, along with their relatives the caimans and the gavials, are very much alike. These crocodilians are reptiles with long snouts, long tails, four short legs, tough skin, and sharp teeth. There are some differences, however. Gavials have the longest snout and the most teeth. Some people say that alligators and crocodiles differ in the shape of their snouts and the positioning of their teeth. Zooke.epers say that crocodiles move faster than alligators and have nastier dispositions.

Recently, scientists have gained an
understanding of a crocodile's
reproductive activity. Crocodiles mate
in the water, where the buoyancy
keeps them from crushing each other.
Prior to mating, there are stylized
postures, jumping, submerged bubble
blowing, and snout contact. After
mating, hard-shelled eggs are laid in a
nest, in a hole scooped in the sand.
When it is time to hatch, the infant
crocodiles begin a loud chirping sound
that leads the female to the nest,
which she excavates. Finally, when all
the babies are accounted for the
mother crocodile, transports them to
the shallow water where they will
remain under adult protection for

1 All crocodilians are reptiles with long snouts, long tails, four short legs. tough skin, and sharp teeth. Members of the crocodilian family include alligators, crocodiles, caimans, and gavials Crocodilians live in warm weather throughout the year and they spend part of their time in the water and part of their time on land. Almost all crocodilians grow to be very large, with the largest more than twenty feet long. There are two kinds of alligators. 14 kinds of crocodiles, eight kinds of caimans, and one kind of gavial.

2 Recently, scientists have gained an understanding of a crocodile's reproductive activity. Crocodiles mate in the water, where the buoyancy keeps them from crushing each other. Prior to mating, there are stylized postures, jumping, submerged bubble blowing, and snout contact. After mating, hard-shelled eggs are laid in a nest, in a hole scooped in the sand. When it is time to hatch, the infant crocodiles begin a loud chirping sound that leads the female to the nest, which she excavates. Finally, when all the babies are accounted for, the mother crocodile, transports them to the shallow water where they will remain under adult protection for weeks or months.
3. On the river banks of the Nile River, home to some crocodiles, there are many kinds of birds, sometimes called crocodile birds because they are always hopping around crocodiles. The big crocodiles and the birds are useful to each other for several reasons. The birds eat flies and leeches that they find on the crocodiles' skin and mouths. In this way, the birds get a good meal and the crododiles get rid of the leeches and flies Sometimes an enemy frightens the birds who scream and fly away. As a result of the noise, the birds give the crocodiles a warning of danger.

4. In most parts of the world there are not as many crocodiles as there used to be. This is a problem because crocodiles are becoming endangered and also crocodiles are necessary to the balance of nature. Many crocodiles have died because people dried up the swamps and marshes where the crocodiles live. Poachers have also contributed to the dilemma as crocodiles have been desired for their strong, smooth, leathery skins. In order to preserve these mighty creatures, people must take care of crocodiles' environment and help put a stop to the needless shooting of these animals.
5. Alligators and crocodiles, along with their relatives the caimans and the gavials, are very much alike. These crocodilians are reptiles with long snouts, long tails, four short legs, tough skin, and sharp teeth. There are some differences, however. Gavials have the longest snout and the most teeth. Some people say that alligators and crocodiles differ in the shape of their snouts and the positioning of their teeth. Zooke.epers say that crocodiles move faster than alligators and have nastier dispositions.

Prior to mating, there are stylized postures, jumping, submerged bubble blowing, and snout contact. After mating, hard- shelled eggs are laid in a nest, in a hole scooped in the sand. When it is time to hatch, the infant crocodiles begin a loud chirping sound that leads the female to the nest, which she excavates. Finally, when all the babies are accounted for, the mother crocodile, transports them to the shallow water where they will remain under adult protection for weeks or months.Types of text:____________________________Purpose/s:___________________________________________________________Signal words:1.2.3.4.5.3.) On the river banks of the Nile River, home to some crocodiles, there are many kinds of birds, sometimes called crocodile birds because they are always hopping around crocodiles. The big crocodiles and the birds are useful to each other for several reasons. The birds eat flies and leeches that they find on the crocodile's skin and mouths. In this way, the birds get a good meal and the crocodiles get rid of the leeches and flies. Sometimes an enemy frightens the birds who scream and fly away. As a result of the noise, the birds give the crocodiles a warning of danger.Types of text:______________________________Purpose/s:_____________________________________________________Signal words:1.2.3.4.) In most parts of the world there are not as many crocodiles as there used to be. This is a because crocodiles are becoming endangered and also crocodiles are necessary to the balance of nature. Many crocodiles have died because people dried up the swamps and marshes where the crocodiles live. Poachers have also contributed to the dilemma as crocodiles have been desired for their strong, smooth, leathery skins. In order to preserve these mighty creatures, people must take care of crocodiles’ environment and help put a stop to the needless shooting of these animals.Types of text:_____________________________Purpose/s:___________________________________________________________Signal words:1.2.Doon sa pic po yung mga iaanswer mo po, please be honest po.Explanation:​</h2><br />
