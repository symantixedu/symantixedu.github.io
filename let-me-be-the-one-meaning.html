What are the clues in this expression? Who is being blamed? Would a fight involve only one person? Therefore, what is the meaning of this idiomatic expression? It means involving two persons.​</a>

                                            CROSSING THE BAR by Alfred Lord Tennyson Sunset and evening star, And one clear call for me! And may there be no moaning of the bar, When I put out to sea, But such a tide as moving seems asleep, Too full for sound and foam, When that which drew from out the boundless deep Turns again home Twilight and evening bell, And after that the dark! And may there be no sadness of farewell, When I embark; For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place The flood may bear me far, I hope to see my Pilot face to face When I have crost the bar. Let's Discuss and Analyze Together1. What do sunset and evening star symbolize? 2. What does turns again home in Stanza 2 mean? 3. Who is the entity referred to by the word Pilot in Stanza 4? 4. What does "crossing the bar" mean? 5. How can you relate the meaning of the poem to your personal experiences? 6. Can you associate this with other people's experiences? Explain.​</a>

And promised three words you know you'll never meet Remember when I believed You meant it when you said it first to me? And now I'm pickin' her apart Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart But she's beautiful, she looks kind She probably gives you butterflies - [Chorus] I hope you're happy But not like how you were with me I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go So find someone great, but don't find no one better I hope you're happy I wish you all the best, really Say you love her, baby Just not like you loved me And think of me fondly when your hands are on her I hope you're happy, but don't be happier - [Bridge] Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh - [Chorus] I hope you're happy Just not like how you were with me I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go So find someone great, but don't find no one better I hope you're happy but don't be happier​                                   -Olivia Rodrigo​</a>

                            2. Identify the meaning of the "Jesus, Take the wheel"
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause i can't do this on my own
Im letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm on
Jesus take the wheel</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The word "Wheel" was used as a Methapor in this song, the wheel refers to a person's life and how he does not know what to do with the life he currently lives in, so he has given up on the path of his life that he lives in to Jesus so that he can be guided and not forsaken.</p><p></p><br />

                            3. 2. Please don't put all the blame on me for our fight. It takes two to tango. What about dancing in a fight? Looks weird. Again let's try context clues. What are the clues in this expression? Who is being blamed? Would a fight involve only one person? Therefore, what is the meaning of this idiomatic expression? It means involving two persons.​</h2><br />

                            16. CROSSING THE BAR by Alfred Lord Tennyson Sunset and evening star, And one clear call for me! And may there be no moaning of the bar, When I put out to sea, But such a tide as moving seems asleep, Too full for sound and foam, When that which drew from out the boundless deep Turns again home Twilight and evening bell, And after that the dark! And may there be no sadness of farewell, When I embark; For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place The flood may bear me far, I hope to see my Pilot face to face When I have crost the bar. Let's Discuss and Analyze Together1. What do sunset and evening star symbolize? 2. What does turns again home in Stanza 2 mean? 3. Who is the entity referred to by the word Pilot in Stanza 4? 4. What does "crossing the bar" mean? 5. How can you relate the meaning of the poem to your personal experiences? 6. Can you associate this with other people's experiences? Explain.​</h2><br />

I described lots of things about Sunset star and Evening star</p><p>It describes about "Moaning the bar", "The tide as moving seems asleep" and "Too full for sound and foam".</p><p>2. That's the tide, being drawn out into the sea (Or "boundless deep") by the moon when the tide is low.</p><p>3. The pilot is a metaphor for God, whom the speaker hopes to meet the face to face</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I really hope it helps but thats all what i know i just answered 1-3</p><p>But please brainliest my answer if it helps</p><br />

And promised three words you know you'll never meet Remember when I believed You meant it when you said it first to me? And now I'm pickin' her apart Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart But she's beautiful, she looks kind She probably gives you butterflies - [Chorus] I hope you're happy But not like how you were with me I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go So find someone great, but don't find no one better I hope you're happy I wish you all the best, really Say you love her, baby Just not like you loved me And think of me fondly when your hands are on her I hope you're happy, but don't be happier - [Bridge] Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh - [Chorus] I hope you're happy Just not like how you were with me I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go So find someone great, but don't find no one better I hope you're happy but don't be happier​                                   -Olivia Rodrigo​</h2><br />
