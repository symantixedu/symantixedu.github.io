Friction produces heat in different machine parts making it waste the energy as heat energy. 3. Brakes in a car is an application of motion. 4. Moving parts in a car engine is desirable. 5. Less effort is required to move a heavy block on a rough surface than on a smooth surface. 6. The rubbing of your hands together is an example of friction. 7. If you push or pull against an object in motion, it will start. 8. Smooth surfaces create the most friction. 9. Low friction will slow down something and will create lot of heat. 10. Moving objects like cars run easily and fast in a smooth surface. $​</a>

(It, They) can operate with extreme wide range of tasks with programs installed in it. 17. (ButAlso) are these enough to replace teachers? Machines, just like computers can work 24/7 with good maintenance on them. They are easy to use and come in handy. If connected to the internet , all information are just on the tip of a finger. 18. (However, Moreover) education is not just about learning facts and data. It is a lifetime process of facilitating teaming, acquiring knowledge, and continuously attaining of goals. Unlike a memory-limited computer, teachers can do immeasurable things for their students. 19. (For instance, But) teachers dedicate themselves in encouraging their learners to do best and realize what they are capable of doing. Also, they inspire students to be Successful in their chosen careers. Teachers give children purpose and drive them to do well in life. 20. (To conclude, In addition) technology is a great tool in advocating education. But still , no machines like computers can replace a teacher. It simply takes a humane commitment to be one.

It must be fed to be able to do work. In like manner, the machine needs gasoline to be able to do its job. Without adequate supply of gasoline it will not run. The human body must allowed to rest to give it time to regain its lost energy. The machine must allowed to rest, too, for continuous work will shorten its life. On the other hand, the human body can detect pain and messages to the brain. Thus further pain can be prevented and something can be done to avoid breakdown. This is not so with the machine. It cannot send messages that is about to break down. When it cannot take the wear and tear any longer, it just breaks down.1. What two items are compared? 2. On what points are they compared? 3.

It must be fed to be able to do work. In like manner, the machine needs gasoline to be able to do its job. Without adequate supply of gasoline it will not run. The human body must allowed to rest to give it time to regain its lost energy. The machine must allowed to rest, too, for continuous work will shorten its life. On the other hand, the human body can detect pain and messages to the brain. Thus further pain can be prevented and something can be done to avoid breakdown. This is not so with the machine. It cannot send messages that is about to break down. When it cannot take the wear and tear any longer, it just breaks down.1. What two items are compared? 2. On what points are they compared? 3.
