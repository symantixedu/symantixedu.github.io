                                            My name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in abig family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be anice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do myhomework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed tomake them leave.Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to seewho's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of themwere out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. Asluck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here andthere. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked aboutthe homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind offamilyMother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me booksto keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and unclesbrought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then Irealized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what wouldhave happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the foreheadand said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I lovemy family so much that I can't live without them.Activity 1Directions: Answer the following questions based from the story read. Use your English activity notebook.Guide Questions:1.

LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

                                            My name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in a
big family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.
One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be a
nice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do my
homework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed to
make them leave.
Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to see
who's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of them
were out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. As
luck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !
remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here and
there. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,
I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked about
the homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind of
family
Mother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me books
to keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and uncles
brought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.
Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then I
realized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what would
have happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead
and said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I love
my family so much that I can't live without them.

                                            all of my siblings and parents are homophobic, and being the youngest daughter I'm lesbian but they don't know that i like girls. A news showed in our T.V of a married lesbians couple, and i saw how my father reacts, and he even cursed the couples saying that they are idiots because they are both girls. I am deeply hurt at that time but i didn't say anything and choose to be quite. I'm very scared how will they going to react if they'll going to find out that i like the same gender (girlXgirl). And also, my mother shared a story about her co-teacher being lesbian, that teacher has a relationship with a girl but a few years, she broke up with her girlfried and choosed to marry a man, and i ask my mother why they both broke up, and she said that its not good being in a relationship with the same gender according to Bible, but i also said that it doesn't matter if you love each others even your same gender, but she disagreed at my statement and i ask her once again if she's homophobic,but she didn't answer my question. Instead of answering my question she said that she silently DISGUSTED to her co-teacher because she loved the same gender, and once i heard what she say, i already know that she's homophobic. I feel very very bad for my self and im scared already to love someone because of them. SHOULD I TAKE THE RISK LOVING SOMEONE IN SAME GENDER OR JUST LET IT GO AND LOVE A MAN? i'm having a lot of problem into these days but no one can even help me, even my own family can't help me.this is not a part of my school work but im just sharing my problems in here, cause why not?:)​</a>

I lovemy family so much that I can't live without them.Activity 1Directions: Answer the following questions based from the story read. Use your English activity notebook.Guide Questions:1.

Although transitional words and phrases mean little by themselves, they are very important in linking your ideas together smoothly and logically so that your paragraphs have coherence. Transitional words and phrases can be divided into categories according to the kind of relationship you as a writer are trying to show. There are eight (8) basic categories you must learn:</p><p></p><p><strong>To Show Time.</strong> after, afterward, always, as soon as, at last, at once, briefly, eventually, finally, immediately, in the meantime, in the past (or future), last, later, meanwhile, next, never, now, often, once, promptly, sometimes, soon.<br /><strong>To Show Place.</strong> above, among, around, at this point, behind, below, beside, beyond, down, forward, from, here, in front of, inside, nearby, next to, on, on the other side, opposite, over, through.</p><p><strong>To Add An Idea.</strong> again, also, and, as well as, besides, for one thing, further, furthermore, in addition to, last, likewise, more, moreover, next, similarly, too.</p><p><strong>To Illustrate or Explain an Idea.</strong> for example, for instance, in other words, in particular, namely, specifically, such as, that is, thus, to illustrate.<br /><br /><strong>To Compare or Contrast Ideas.</strong> but, even so, conversely, differently, however, in contrast, in spite of, in the same way, nevertheless, on the contrary, on the other hand, still,yet.</p><p><strong>To Show a Result.</strong> accordingly, as a result, consequently, for that reason, hence, then, therefore, thus.</p><p><strong>To Empasize an Idea</strong>. above all, especially, indeed, in fact, most important.</p><p><strong>To Summarize an Idea.</strong> as has been noted, finally, in brief, in other words, in short, on the whole, to sum up.</p><p>These are not all of the transitional words and phrases in the English language that we use, but they represent a good sampling of those most often employed in writing. Remember that transitions are like bridges -- they link one thing with another. They can be used to go forward (on to the next sentence or paragraph) or to go backward (to refer to something that has just been stated). The following is a brief listing of commonly used transitional words and phrases one finds in daily speech:</p><p></p><p><strong>and            before                     nevertheless          accordingly</strong></p><p><strong>or              otherwise                unfortunately         but</strong></p><p><strong>when         however                  recently                   for</strong></p><p><strong>after          therefore                although                  for example</strong></p><p><strong>so             consequently          at last                      in conclusion<br /><br /><br />I'm not really sure about my answer, but hope this helps and gives you an idea on how to answer it. <br /><br />Thank you for understanding :)</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            6. My name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in abig family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be anice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do myhomework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed tomake them leave.Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to seewho's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of themwere out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. Asluck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here andthere.

LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

                            12. My name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in a
big family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.
One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be a
nice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do my
homework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed to
make them leave.
Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to see
who's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of them
were out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. As
luck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !
remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here and
there. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,
I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked about
the homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind of
family
Mother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me books
to keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and uncles
brought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.
Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then I
realized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what would
have happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead
and said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I love
my family so much that I can't live without them.

                            20. all of my siblings and parents are homophobic, and being the youngest daughter I'm lesbian but they don't know that i like girls. A news showed in our T.V of a married lesbians couple, and i saw how my father reacts, and he even cursed the couples saying that they are idiots because they are both girls. I am deeply hurt at that time but i didn't say anything and choose to be quite. I'm very scared how will they going to react if they'll going to find out that i like the same gender (girlXgirl). And also, my mother shared a story about her co-teacher being lesbian, that teacher has a relationship with a girl but a few years, she broke up with her girlfried and choosed to marry a man, and i ask my mother why they both broke up, and she said that its not good being in a relationship with the same gender according to Bible, but i also said that it doesn't matter if you love each others even your same gender, but she disagreed at my statement and i ask her once again if she's homophobic,but she didn't answer my question. Instead of answering my question she said that she silently DISGUSTED to her co-teacher because she loved the same gender, and once i heard what she say, i already know that she's homophobic. I feel very very bad for my self and im scared already to love someone because of them. SHOULD I TAKE THE RISK LOVING SOMEONE IN SAME GENDER OR JUST LET IT GO AND LOVE A MAN? i'm having a lot of problem into these days but no one can even help me, even my own family can't help me.this is not a part of my school work but im just sharing my problems in here, cause why not?:)​</h2><br />

                            22. Love Your FamilyMy name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in abig family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be anice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do myhomework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed tomake them leave.Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to seewho's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of themwere out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. Asluck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here andthere. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked aboutthe homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind offamilyMother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me booksto keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and unclesbrought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then Irealized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what wouldhave happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the foreheadand said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I lovemy family so much that I can't live without them.Activity 1Directions: Answer the following questions based from the story read. Use your English activity notebook.Guide Questions:1.
