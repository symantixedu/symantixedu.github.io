                        Traditionally, gender roles in the Philippines have been strongly influenced by cultural and religious beliefs. Men are typically expected to be the breadwinners and protectors of the family, while women are expected to take care of the household and children. Women are also expected to be respectful, modest, and obedient.<br /><br />However, these gender roles are not fixed, and they vary depending on factors such as socio-economic status, education, and location. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the need to challenge gender stereotypes and promote gender equality in the Philippines. Many women are now pursuing higher education and entering the workforce, and men are taking on more domestic responsibilities.<br /><br />Despite these changes, gender-based discrimination and violence against women continue to be significant problems in the Philippines. Efforts are ongoing to address these issues and promote gender equality.<br />

"In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare employs several dramatic techniques that have gamered praise from critics, most notably the abrupt shifts from comedy to tragedy.

The feud is also linked to male virility, as the numerous jokes about maidenheads aptly demonstrate. Juliet also submits to a female code of docility by allowing others, such as the Friar, to solve her problems for her. 4.

                            9. Smash the Alcohol Addiction!
Many young people have stuck to their bad habits, drowned by their addiction,
lost motivation to become better in their life, and easily Iose their way when they have
problems. One of the reasons is the early addiction to alcohol at a young age. As
prevention, the Tarlac City School Division Office and Alvindia-Aguso High School
implemented activities under "SMASHED PH, an Alcohol Education Empowering the
Youth program of Depart of Education
Alcohol drink contains ethanol, an alcohol that acts as a drug produced by
fermentation of grains, sugar, or fruits. It will give pleasurable feelings and blunt
negative feelings to a drinker, but this can affect the normal development of the brain,
liver, and hormones. Starting drinking underage, especially age before 14 is
associated with increased high health risks, physically and mentally. According to
research data from World Health Organization, 9% of the Philippine's population
estimated at 86 milion who are 15 years old and above have an alcohol use disorder.
25% of males and 8.3% of females are heavy drinkers.
Peer pressure is among the most common reason for underage drinking. Lack
of parental boundaries, coping with an underlying problem, to appear matured or
environmental influences. Prevention of the alcoholism will have a positive effect on
mental health and improve the energy levels of the people. With the help of
"SMASHED PH," launched on April 22, 2022, with the collaboration of AAHS Supreme
Student Government and Barkada Kontra Droga, the students have thought and
educated about Alcoholism's effects on their bodies. They conducted activities like
Jingle making and role-playing acting a scenario about it. Aside from those developing</h2><br />
