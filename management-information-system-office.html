This starts with admission of students to the university. When a regular student, i.e. a student who comes from a Dutch high-school, sends in his admission form such a student is registered by the admissions office. Subsequently, the eligibility to study in a certain program is checked based on the information that the student provided on his admission form. For students who arrive from another school, such as a polytechnic, the previous study that the student took, according to his admission form, must be examined in detail. Polytechnic students can either come to the university after completing one year of courses (propedeuse) or after receiving a polytechnic diploma. Students from universities in other countries are also accepted. Also for them, the studies that they took previously must be examined in detail. When students are considered eligible and the courses that they have already followed (if applicable) check out, they are enrolled at the university, which involves sending a letter that they are accepted and entering the details of their enrollment in the information system of the university. The students then become a student of their respective study: industrial engineering, building or construction engineering. After the students are enrolled, they can take courses or do projects and they can use the services that are provided by the university, which include: language training and sports facilities. Projects are done on an individual basis by a student together with a lecturer. The university recognizes part-time students who do their studies while they are working in a company. These students typically do projects of a more practical nature than the other students, such that the process that is followed during the project are also different for these students. Design a process architecture as follows: 1. identify the case types that should appear in the process architecture 2. identify the functions that should appear in the process architecture 3. draw a case/function matrix 4. identify the processes in the case function matrix, split up processes if and only if one of the guidelines applies, clearly indicate which guideline you applied where​</a>

                                            Hi Jane, I heard from Alex that you landed a new large business account yesterday. He said that you did an excellent job in explaining the company’s benefits to the customer and that you were very professional.Alex also said that the customer asked for a quote on a new phone system for his existing offices. Have you thought about how you will proceed? Let me know if I can help you get the quote together or if you need any ideas on the configuration. I'd like to get the quote to the later this week if you think you can manage it. That way we would have a good chance of getting the order in for this month’s numbers.Thanks again, and hope you are having a good Tuesday so far !  Anne 1.What is the main point of the communication?2.What is there quested action?3.

This starts with admission of students to the university. When a regular student, i.e. a student who comes from a Dutch high-school, sends in his admission form such a student is registered by the admissions office. Subsequently, the eligibility to study in a certain program is checked based on the information that the student provided on his admission form. For students who arrive from another school, such as a polytechnic, the previous study that the student took, according to his admission form, must be examined in detail. Polytechnic students can either come to the university after completing one year of courses (propedeuse) or after receiving a polytechnic diploma. Students from universities in other countries are also accepted. Also for them, the studies that they took previously must be examined in detail. When students are considered eligible and the courses that they have already followed (if applicable) check out, they are enrolled at the university, which involves sending a letter that they are accepted and entering the details of their enrollment in the information system of the university. The students then become a student of their respective study: industrial engineering, building or construction engineering. After the students are enrolled, they can take courses or do projects and they can use the services that are provided by the university, which include: language training and sports facilities. Projects are done on an individual basis by a student together with a lecturer. The university recognizes part-time students who do their studies while they are working in a company. These students typically do projects of a more practical nature than the other students, such that the process that is followed during the project are also different for these students. Design a process architecture as follows: 1. identify the case types that should appear in the process architecture 2. identify the functions that should appear in the process architecture 3. draw a case/function matrix 4. identify the processes in the case function matrix, split up processes if and only if one of the guidelines applies, clearly indicate which guideline you applied where​</h2><br />
