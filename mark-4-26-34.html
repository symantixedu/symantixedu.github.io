                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I can help you with this problem. I assume you want to find the ages of S and C in terms of x, where x is the common factor of their ages. To do this, we need to use the ratio and the given information. Let’s write the ratio as:</p><p></p><p>S/C = 3/2</p><p></p><p>This means that S is 3 times some number x, and C is 2 times some number x. So we can write:</p><p></p><p>S = 3x C = 2x</p><p></p><p>Now, we are given that five years later, the sum of their ages will be 40. That means:</p><p></p><p>(S + 5) + (C + 5) = 40</p><p></p><p>Substituting S and C with 3x and 2x, we get:</p><p></p><p>(3x + 5) + (2x + 5) = 40</p><p></p><p>Simplifying and solving for x, we get:</p><p></p><p>5x + 10 = 40 5x = 30 x = 6</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the value of x is 6. To find the ages of S and C, we just need to plug in x into the expressions for S and C:</p><p></p><p>S = 3x = 3 × 6 = 18 C = 2x = 2 × 6 = 12</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the age of S is 18 years and the age of C is 12 years.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
