Gaze 15. salient -numbers 1 to 15 are the choicesslogan In this poster we are presented with a highly emotive black and white 1.imageol a young man holding towards the camera his right arm, which has been amputated below the elbow. Below the photograph, on a contrasting orange, red and yellow background is a pun "Trespassing could cost you more than a $200 fine.' At the foot of the poster the crossed railway tracks become a symbolic cross, signifying death, and together with the imperative Stay off the tracks, and slogan "There's no good reason for you to be on the tracks. The penalty is $200 or your life' bring across a strong message for the Transperth and Public Transport Authority WA railway campaign.The oblique, slightly 2.___high-angled shot focuses on es faci expression, but the stump is more satient by being deliberately placed closest to the viewer. His face, un smiling, is lit by 3.___and surrounded by shadow. His nakedness suggests vulnerability but his facial expression could also suggest that he is accepting of the loss and feel comfortable enough to display it to a wider audience. He is not looking at the viewer, but away into the distance-an uverted Gaze. This allows the4.___ to be non-confrontational - as the viewer we are able to look at liis injury with curiosity or pity or whatever emotions we feel and noticel guilty for judging bi or examining the stump closely. There is a sense of Direct Chaze as he wants 18 to look all his urn. The shadow is in subtle 5.___around the vicum By viewing the person, not just the amputation, it is more real, more human and we realize that accidents like this do happen. The bright omnge, red and yellow6.___of thic background provide contrast to the photograph above, but they also add weight to achieve balance willing the poster The 7.___of the poster relies on the golden rectangle or the golden ratio that is visually or aesthetically pleasing The photograph, although smaller than the much larger contrasting section is chic more 8.___ in terms of the composition. The emphasis and unpact lic with the photograph. The colors are 9.___of langer and there is deliberate 10.___ with the red-orange around the care of the yellow center. The yellow, usually associated with happiness, draws attention to the symbolic railway cross at its heart. The use of space between the pan and the cross helps the viewer to glean several messages from the poster. The bold black capitalized font of the 11___is centered. The use of the capitalized 12.___which is more difficult to read than lower case, makes us concentrate on what the punis saying, as we make links to the image above The 13.___devices used in the poster are clear in their message.The pun is less direct than other examples of language used as it requires some thinking and linking between the image and language. The two meanings of cost' refer to a financial cost of $200 but more importantly, the physical and emotional impact of the loss of a limb or (as another link is made to the symbolic railway cross) ultimately the loss of life. The use of the personal pronoun "you" directly targets the viewer and the imperative commands the vicwer to "Stay of the tracks' The 14.___ while having a colloquial lone, reiterates the ultimatum to the viewer, with "The penalty is $200 or your life" The use of 15.___ here seems almost an understatement when referring to the loss of life.uhm i will accept 2 dares sa magsagot ng matino, thanks. ​</a>

                        <p>The poster is talking about<strong> a holistic view of life</strong>. </p><p><strong>Mind, body, and soul</strong> are three important and core subjects under study when discussing the philosophy of life. The understanding of the relationship between what we called soul and body has always been a source of concern among philosophers, who believe it. The existence of a soul and justifying the mind as a separate entity from the brain is never completely understood. The relationship of the mind with the body for example how the mind controls the body and how changes in the body affect the mind is always been the main issue in studying the philosophy of mind. </p><p><strong>Mind</strong> is a complex and hard subject. Some of the functions of the mind work independently from the body. But others do work collaborated with <strong>the body</strong>. Philosophers have accomplished a variety of studies to understand the actual role and existence of a mind including if the mind is a physical or non-physical matter or if it’s a part of the <strong>body or the soul</strong>. And other issues like that. Body and soul give a good explanation of all these problems. Though there are objections to thinking about it. But it does address all issues of independent working of mind and body, to contribute to how visualized life was.</p><p>Yoga is a spiritual discipline based on an incredibly delicate science that focuses on achieving mental and physical equilibrium. It is both an art and a science to live a healthy lifestyle. It is necessary to adopt a holistic perspective on life.</p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Learn more about the holistic view:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/5824607</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>yan lang</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Efficient strategies to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are peremptory to relieve the negatively impacted public health and global economy, with the full scope yet to unfold. In the absence of highly effective drugs, vaccines, and abundant medical resources, many measures are used to manage the infection rate and avoid exhausting limited hospital resources. Wearing masks is among the non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures that could be effectively implemented at a minimum cost and without dramatically disrupting social practices. The mask-wearing guidelines vary significantly across countries. Regardless of the debates in the medical community and the global mask production shortage, more countries and regions are moving forward with recommendations or mandates to wear masks in public. Our study combines mathematical modeling and existing scientific evidence to evaluate the potential impact of the utilization of normal medical masks in public to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider three key factors that contribute to the effectiveness of wearing a quality mask in reducing the transmission risk, including the mask aerosol reduction rate, mask population coverage, and mask availability. We first simulate the impact of these three factors on the virus reproduction number and infection attack rate in a general population. Using the intervened viral transmission route by wearing a mask, we further model the impact of mask-wearing on the epidemic curve with increasing mask awareness and availability. Our study indicates that wearing a face mask can be effectively combined with social distancing to flatten the epidemic curve. Wearing a mask presents a rational way to implement as an NPI to combat COVID-19. We recognize our study provides a projection based only on currently available data and estimates potential probabilities. As such, our model warrants further validation studies.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.If we are in public and cannot maintain six feet of social distance between ourselves and others, then it is important that we wear a mask to slow the spread of coronavirus.21 Jul 2020</p><p>2.Follow the rules the government had Given</p><p>3.Even “nutritious” cereal choices, such as granola that contain oats, are often loaded with sugar. A high sugar intake may raise the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other chronic health conditions ( 2 ).

The two meanings of cost' refer to a financial cost of $200 but more importantly, the physical and emotional impact of the loss of a limb or (as another link is made to the symbolic railway cross) ultimately the loss of life. The use of the personal pronoun "you" directly targets the viewer and the imperative commands the vicwer to "Stay of the tracks' The 14.___ while having a colloquial lone, reiterates the ultimatum to the viewer, with "The penalty is $200 or your life" The use of 15.___ here seems almost an understatement when referring to the loss of life.uhm i will accept 2 dares sa magsagot ng matino, thanks. ​</h2><br />
