                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>As an Oceanographer who is working to map the ocean floor off the eastern coast of the Philippines, I would certainly notice the portion which is much deeper than the rest.

We can find it along the western side of the <strong>Philippine plat</strong>e in the <strong>Pacific Ocean.</strong> It can be more than 10,500 meters at its deepest portion.

                        <p>If in the ocean floor, an oceanographer notices a portion in the ocean floor that is deeper than the rest of the ocean floor it is most likely an <strong>OCEAN TRENCH.</strong></p><p></p><p>To understand how ocean trenches are formed an understanding of the <strong>Plate Tectonic Theory</strong> must be gained. The tectonic plate theory posits that the outermost layer of the Earth, called the crust, is composed of “plates”. There are two types of plates, the oceanic plates, and the continental plates. In prehistoric times all continents used to be one big continental plate called the Pangaea. Over time, movements from the Earth’s second layer, the mantle, caused this prehistoric supercontinent to break up and eventually settle into the present </p><p></p><p>The movement and collision of these plates cause various landforms and ocean forms to be made. A type of collision of continental plates is the reason for the formation of mountains.</p><p></p><p>In the case of ocean trenches, <strong>it is formed through a type of interaction between oceanic plates where one plate goes under called </strong><strong>subduction.</strong></p><p></p><p>To learn more about oceanic plates, see: https://brainly.ph/question/8309690</p><p></p><p>#SPJ4</p><p><strong></strong></p><br />

I could have run and pretended that I wasn’t there at all… instead I went straight to the vice principal’s office and confessed. I was shaking and crying.

                            25. Ms. Dimatanaw is a Filipino woman who wants to have a proper education but she belongs to the lower class status. According to the Spaniards who colonized the Philippines only males and elites are allowed for education. According to Rizal what does Ms. Dimatanaw most likely to have?</h2><br />
                        <p>According to Rizal, <strong>Ms. Dimatanaw</strong> most likely has <strong>prejudicial treatment </strong>from the <strong>Spaniards</strong>. </p><p></p><p>During the<strong> Spanish colonization</strong>, women were commonly found inside the houses doing <strong>house chores </strong>for their husbands and their families. Having this fact, women were considered a species without the right to education. Those who were elite and male by birth were the ones who have the luxury of education.</p><p></p><p>Definitely, there was huge <strong>discrimination </strong>against <strong>women</strong> during the colonization of the Hispanics in the Philippines. However, after the enactment of Title IX in 1972, the federal law secured the right to an education free from sex discrimination, letting every woman enter universities, institutions, and the like to achieve their <strong>academic</strong> goals. This year is the first year in the Philippines to promote gender equality.</p><p></p><p>If you would like to learn more about the events in the pre-Spanish era in the Philippines, kindly please take your time to visit this link:https://brainly.ph/question/2500145</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                        ANSWER:<p>The correct answer is <strong>Trench</strong>. A <strong>trench</strong> is the portion in the ocean floor which is relatively much deeper than the rest of the ocean floor.</p><p></p>EXPLANATION:<p>Linear sea is <strong>not the correct answer</strong> because linear sea is no way related to uneven ocean floor. Linear sea is the result of the increase in length and depth of a rift valley due to the continues spreading of the plates.</p><p></p><p>Oceanic ridge is <strong>not the correct answer</strong> because it is a seafloor or underwater mountain range. Clearly, it does not point to a depression in the ocean floor which is what we are looking.</p><p></p><p>Rift valley is <strong>not the correct</strong> because rift valley points to the fracture of the Earth's surface that widens over time.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Read more here:</p><p>What is fault and trench?</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1236853</p><p>Mariana's trench</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/168998</p><p>Connection of volcanoes and trenches</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1404356</p>#LetsStudy<br />
