When cowboys dismount or are bucked off of bulls at riding competitions, rodeo clowns jump in front of the bulls and motion wildly to get their attention. In this way rodeo clowns provide an alternate target, and in doing so protect the rider.

Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers. Faults are considered to be active if they have moved one or more times in at least 10,000 years. Active faults are structure along which we expect displacement to occur. Inactive faults are structures that we can identify but which co not have earthquakes. There are five major active faults in the Philippines: the Central Philippine Fault, Marikina Valley Fault, Western Filippine Fault, Eastern Philippine Fault, and Southern of Mindanao Fazic.
