It was Thrift Week. "Who among you are saving money?," Miss Sanchez asked. Many of the children raised their hands. "Where do you keep the money you save?," Miss Sanchez asked. "In a piggy bank, Ma'am," Elsie said. "In a milk can," Lucio said. "I keep my money in a bamboo shell," Lito said. Pa answer po sana ng maayos :&gt; ​ </a>

Good day!
How are you, my friend? What keeps you busy these days? I hope you
are having a good time. Isn’t it that the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us a
lot of things? For me, I learned to value more of my family, friends, and
everything God gives me. Aside from that, I also learned to make myself busy,
even if I stay at home. I am happy to share with you my daily activities.

                                            My Quarantine Story Donna Teressa M. Oropel It was a busy and ordinary day in March when I heard the news about the spreading virus— which, unfortunately, found to be deadly and dangerous because it attacks the body, specifically the immune system and the respiratory system. After hearing such dispiriting news, I, and the people in my workplace received a piece of advice to take precautionary measures and to stop reporting physically due to the threatening pandemic. It was the time when my Quarantine life started— from predictable and habitual routines to unexpected ones. My days always start with waking up early in the morning, clueless of what to do. I often ask myself, "Is there something productive to do?" Since I was clueless as ever, I started to plan everything out. I began to focus on improving my health by staying fit. I decided to have my daily exercise since my body had not been sweating out lately on account of being too pre-occupied with my job. I also included reading books and enrolling myself in free online classes to feed my intellect and broaden my knowledge. Then, when I have free time, I spoil myself with food, just enough, and with movies by binge-watching on Netflix. My Quarantine life may sound relaxing and fun, but it is not. With the news spreading and circulating on the internet about the increasing cases of people who caught the virus, I could not help but be anxious and sad about it. Many people lost their jobs and businesses— small or large scale, and it led to the extreme poverty of some. With that, every household must watch how they spend their money. Proper budgeting is a must to survive in this crisis. And as for my family, we only buy groceries once a week, and everything is already budgeted; it is not the best time to spend money on nonessentials. Lastly, with everything that is going on, I never forget to pray for the complete healing and safety of everybody. Praying the Holy Rosary is the last thing I do with my family before going to bed.My Quarantine life is not as fun or as exciting as always. However, in conclusion, the experiences I had while staying at home with my family, made me realize and reflect on a lot of things, one of which is the importance of taking good care of my health and appreciate every little time I spend with my loved ones. Life is indeed good, but it is short. It is fun until it is not. Life is unpredictable; we will never know when it will blow its surprise again1. What is the text all about?2.

The pride, care, dedication, effort, and hard-working attitude that I view as critical to any success I may achieve have all descended upon me courtesy of my close-knit, Italian family. Born the child of two immigrants who came here with nothing, only one possessing a college degree, the importance of a good work ethic was stressed by my parents from day one. Through their actions in their jobs and through the verbal lessons on life I began to get from the moment I could communicate, they set an example for me to follow, one of being proud of what I do, no matter what it was, and above all, to care about everything I do as if everything had a big impact. This meant that everything had to be done right and be done well. Undoubtedly, following their own advice carried my parents from their status as blue-collar immigrants who labored as factory workers to white-collar citizens, one of whom owns his own business while the other works as a bank officer. Those ascensions from nothing only served as other examples for me to follow, examples that delineated the ability for a person to improve through effort. Another quotation from my father propelled me from the time I started school to today: "No matter what you do, you have to be the best." This set up the inner drive that motivates all my actions. It was what forced me to try hard in school although I didn't know English well enough to always understand the teacher. It's the reason why I have developed my skills. It accounts for my dedication to all activities, and to the hard work I put into all of them as I strive to lead both in class and out. Essentially, my parentage was the first quality that distinguished me as a leader. Despite all the talk of being a leader, I have never lost sight of the importance of my family. I know I owe my family everything, and as a result, I'll always be close with it.​</a>

family. None of my friends was here to support me. I can’t imagine what
would have happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for
lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead and said, "It’s okay, I know
you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving
family. I love my family so much that I can’t live without them.

                            12. My Quarantine Story Donna Teressa M. Oropel It was a busy and ordinary day in March when I heard the news about the spreading virus— which, unfortunately, found to be deadly and dangerous because it attacks the body, specifically the immune system and the respiratory system. After hearing such dispiriting news, I, and the people in my workplace received a piece of advice to take precautionary measures and to stop reporting physically due to the threatening pandemic. It was the time when my Quarantine life started— from predictable and habitual routines to unexpected ones. My days always start with waking up early in the morning, clueless of what to do. I often ask myself, "Is there something productive to do?" Since I was clueless as ever, I started to plan everything out. I began to focus on improving my health by staying fit. I decided to have my daily exercise since my body had not been sweating out lately on account of being too pre-occupied with my job. I also included reading books and enrolling myself in free online classes to feed my intellect and broaden my knowledge. Then, when I have free time, I spoil myself with food, just enough, and with movies by binge-watching on Netflix. My Quarantine life may sound relaxing and fun, but it is not. With the news spreading and circulating on the internet about the increasing cases of people who caught the virus, I could not help but be anxious and sad about it. Many people lost their jobs and businesses— small or large scale, and it led to the extreme poverty of some. With that, every household must watch how they spend their money. Proper budgeting is a must to survive in this crisis. And as for my family, we only buy groceries once a week, and everything is already budgeted; it is not the best time to spend money on nonessentials. Lastly, with everything that is going on, I never forget to pray for the complete healing and safety of everybody. Praying the Holy Rosary is the last thing I do with my family before going to bed.My Quarantine life is not as fun or as exciting as always. However, in conclusion, the experiences I had while staying at home with my family, made me realize and reflect on a lot of things, one of which is the importance of taking good care of my health and appreciate every little time I spend with my loved ones. Life is indeed good, but it is short. It is fun until it is not. Life is unpredictable; we will never know when it will blow its surprise again1. What is the text all about?2.

Summary of                                                Close knit family I don't view my important characteristics as different from those my family has imparted on me throughout the years. The pride, care, dedication, effort, and hard-working attitude that I view as critical to any success I may achieve have all descended upon me courtesy of my close-knit, Italian family. Born the child of two immigrants who came here with nothing, only one possessing a college degree, the importance of a good work ethic was stressed by my parents from day one. Through their actions in their jobs and through the verbal lessons on life I began to get from the moment I could communicate, they set an example for me to follow, one of being proud of what I do, no matter what it was, and above all, to care about everything I do as if everything had a big impact. This meant that everything had to be done right and be done well. Undoubtedly, following their own advice carried my parents from their status as blue-collar immigrants who labored as factory workers to white-collar citizens, one of whom owns his own business while the other works as a bank officer. Those ascensions from nothing only served as other examples for me to follow, examples that delineated the ability for a person to improve through effort. Another quotation from my father propelled me from the time I started school to today: "No matter what you do, you have to be the best." This set up the inner drive that motivates all my actions. It was what forced me to try hard in school although I didn't know English well enough to always understand the teacher. It's the reason why I have developed my skills. It accounts for my dedication to all activities, and to the hard work I put into all of them as I strive to lead both in class and out. Essentially, my parentage was the first quality that distinguished me as a leader. Despite all the talk of being a leader, I have never lost sight of the importance of my family. I know I owe my family everything, and as a result, I'll always be close with it.​</h2><br />

                            29. Two months had passed like this, I didn’t feel bored or like a
handicap even for a single day. It was then I realized the importance of
family. None of my friends was here to support me. I can’t imagine what
would have happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for
lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead and said, "It’s okay, I know
you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving
family. I love my family so much that I can’t live without them.

Good day!
How are you, my friend? What keeps you busy these days? I hope you
are having a good time. Isn’t it that the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us a
lot of things? For me, I learned to value more of my family, friends, and
everything God gives me. Aside from that, I also learned to make myself busy,
even if I stay at home. I am happy to share with you my daily activities.
