                                            Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.
The western world is in love with the concept of freedom. It is the most precious aspect of society. Whether it is the freedom of religion or speech, the freedom to choose our political leaders, or to pursue the life we choose without fear of interference from individuals or governments, freedom is essential and paramount in all things.
However, when we move from our societal craving for freedom to our personal lives, or the workplace, we seem ready to give up our freedom and are willing to put our happiness and our level of motivation in the hands of someone else. In the workplace we call this someone else "management". It becomes management's job to give us rewarding work, to motivate us, to make us into high-performing individuals and teams. We tell ourselves that our mechanical systems of rewards and punishments, measurements, strategies, or command and control structures get the behaviors that we want from our organizations. In short, we create these devices to help eliminate the need for the exercise of free will.
Koestenbaum and Block suggest that this "escape from freedom," as Erich Fromm called it, is in large part due to the fact that "...with freedom comes accountability, and with accountability comes guilt, and with guilt comes anxiety.
But this creates an interesting paradox. By allowing others to choose I have made a choice. I have chosen to give others the power to choose for me, which in itself is an exercise of my free will. Therefore, I am still accountable, at least to myself, for the results of my decision.
Arguments are sure to be put forward showing how, at least in certain circumstances, I had no choice in the matter: "I hate this job, but if I don't come to work I will be fired. I have no choice but to come to work." Or, "The law says I have to pay my taxes. I have no choice. If I don't pay my taxes I will go to jail."
When these statements are examined more closely we see that there is an element of choice in each. I choose to continue to go work at a job that I hate because I am unwilling to deal with the consequences of walking away from the job. Instead of choosing to look for another job, I choose to continue working at the one I have. I am accountable for my choice to continue in an unpleasant job instead of changing my situation. I choose to pay my taxes because I am not willing to be accountable for the consequences related to not paying my taxes. Regardless of why I made the choice to pay my taxes, it is still my choice to make the payment.
We are not always in control of the alternatives among which we may choose. Having free will does not imply that life will always be perfect, or that the choice of another option would have provided us with great happiness. But through the exercise of our free will we are able to embrace our humanity, and to take on the succession of risks that life has to offer.
Recognizing that we are free gives us the ability to exercise control over our existence, and lets us shift from blaming others for how things are to being accountable for our life. "Once the
 inevitability [that we are accountable] is recognized, we will be inclined to place the full blame [or credit] on ourselves rather than on others or on objective situations beyond our control." (Freedom And Accountability At Work, Koestenbaum and Block, 2001, P. 79)
The good news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of opportunity. The bad news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of accountability.
1. How are Freedom and Accountability related to each other? Explain clearly and comprehensively.

                                            TRUE STORY: TYLER LYBERT I chose the wrong path with drugs and alcohol and now that I am in recovery I have to deal with the choices that I made while using every day for the rest of my life. I destroyed my family, friends and my life. I have been in jail many times, had thousands of dollars in fines, inpatient rehab, car crashes and watched my friends die. If only I had chosen not to take the first drink or drug, my life would be totally different. My advice is not to let other people make choices for you. Life is so much better without drugs and alcohol.__________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________.

                                            identify whether the speech below is memorized, extemporaneous or impromptu.1. My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family. And at a time in our history when heroes were hard to find, I thought I'd found one. I'd never seen anybody so handsome, so physical, so determined, so proud. Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2. "So I'd like you all to charge your glasses and join me in toasting the new Mr and Mrs Brown! Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the bride and groom" "Wishing them all the health, wealth and happiness in the world, I'd like you all to join me in toasting the happy couple3. I always wanted to see what will be my life in the future, what will be my careerand wnat will l'become? As 1 reflected my childhood I have many dreams and aspirations that iwould like to accomplish within the next ten years to come. In ten years, I can see myself havingmany of my goals accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goalsto fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now. I havemost of it planned out already. This is my story.4. On behalf of the Government of Vietnam, I would like to convey my warmest welcome to all distinguished delegates and guests attending the Vietnam Business Summit on the occasion of the 2017 APEC Economic Leaders' Week. May I extend my warmest greetings to all distinguished guests and delegations, representatives from organizations and enterprises, experts and investors Vietnamese and international alike.​</a>

                            9. Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.
The western world is in love with the concept of freedom. It is the most precious aspect of society. Whether it is the freedom of religion or speech, the freedom to choose our political leaders, or to pursue the life we choose without fear of interference from individuals or governments, freedom is essential and paramount in all things.
However, when we move from our societal craving for freedom to our personal lives, or the workplace, we seem ready to give up our freedom and are willing to put our happiness and our level of motivation in the hands of someone else. In the workplace we call this someone else "management". It becomes management's job to give us rewarding work, to motivate us, to make us into high-performing individuals and teams. We tell ourselves that our mechanical systems of rewards and punishments, measurements, strategies, or command and control structures get the behaviors that we want from our organizations. In short, we create these devices to help eliminate the need for the exercise of free will.
Koestenbaum and Block suggest that this "escape from freedom," as Erich Fromm called it, is in large part due to the fact that "...with freedom comes accountability, and with accountability comes guilt, and with guilt comes anxiety.
But this creates an interesting paradox. By allowing others to choose I have made a choice. I have chosen to give others the power to choose for me, which in itself is an exercise of my free will. Therefore, I am still accountable, at least to myself, for the results of my decision.
Arguments are sure to be put forward showing how, at least in certain circumstances, I had no choice in the matter: "I hate this job, but if I don't come to work I will be fired. I have no choice but to come to work." Or, "The law says I have to pay my taxes. I have no choice. If I don't pay my taxes I will go to jail."
When these statements are examined more closely we see that there is an element of choice in each. I choose to continue to go work at a job that I hate because I am unwilling to deal with the consequences of walking away from the job. Instead of choosing to look for another job, I choose to continue working at the one I have. I am accountable for my choice to continue in an unpleasant job instead of changing my situation. I choose to pay my taxes because I am not willing to be accountable for the consequences related to not paying my taxes. Regardless of why I made the choice to pay my taxes, it is still my choice to make the payment.
We are not always in control of the alternatives among which we may choose. Having free will does not imply that life will always be perfect, or that the choice of another option would have provided us with great happiness. But through the exercise of our free will we are able to embrace our humanity, and to take on the succession of risks that life has to offer.
Recognizing that we are free gives us the ability to exercise control over our existence, and lets us shift from blaming others for how things are to being accountable for our life. "Once the
 inevitability [that we are accountable] is recognized, we will be inclined to place the full blame [or credit] on ourselves rather than on others or on objective situations beyond our control." (Freedom And Accountability At Work, Koestenbaum and Block, 2001, P. 79)
The good news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of opportunity. The bad news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of accountability.
1. How are Freedom and Accountability related to each other? Explain clearly and comprehensively.

                            18. TRUE STORY: TYLER LYBERT I chose the wrong path with drugs and alcohol and now that I am in recovery I have to deal with the choices that I made while using every day for the rest of my life. I destroyed my family, friends and my life. I have been in jail many times, had thousands of dollars in fines, inpatient rehab, car crashes and watched my friends die. If only I had chosen not to take the first drink or drug, my life would be totally different. My advice is not to let other people make choices for you. Life is so much better without drugs and alcohol.__________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________. TRUE STORY: JORDAN COLE LUNSFORD After using heroin once, Jordan died. He was a good kid, a happy kid, a kid that was going through a rough moment and his bad choice and the company he kept that night was a recipe for his death. ________________________________________ Questions:1. Why do you think people use drugs?2.What did you learn by reading these stories?REALLY NEED THE ANSWER:/;(​ </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. People use drugs so that they can escape from thier problems. They use it as an excuse to experience temporary pleasure and happiness although in reality this will only do no good for their well-being as well as the people around them. </p><p></p><p>2. I learned that using drugs will never solve the problem or challenge your facing. You can ask for help if you need to. Your family can help you surpass it, you just have to gained enough courage to open up. You also have to be aware of the circle you're in. </p><p></p><br />

                            19. identify whether the speech below is memorized, extemporaneous or impromptu.1. My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family. And at a time in our history when heroes were hard to find, I thought I'd found one. I'd never seen anybody so handsome, so physical, so determined, so proud. Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2. "So I'd like you all to charge your glasses and join me in toasting the new Mr and Mrs Brown! Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the bride and groom" "Wishing them all the health, wealth and happiness in the world, I'd like you all to join me in toasting the happy couple3. I always wanted to see what will be my life in the future, what will be my careerand wnat will l'become? As 1 reflected my childhood I have many dreams and aspirations that iwould like to accomplish within the next ten years to come. In ten years, I can see myself havingmany of my goals accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goalsto fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now. I havemost of it planned out already. This is my story.4. On behalf of the Government of Vietnam, I would like to convey my warmest welcome to all distinguished delegates and guests attending the Vietnam Business Summit on the occasion of the 2017 APEC Economic Leaders' Week. May I extend my warmest greetings to all distinguished guests and delegations, representatives from organizations and enterprises, experts and investors Vietnamese and international alike.​</h2><br />
