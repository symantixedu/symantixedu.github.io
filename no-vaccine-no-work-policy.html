They continue to perform their responsibilities despite the high risk ofbeing exposed to the deadly coronavirus. Among the hundreds of frontliners waging war against the deadly coronavirus onour behalf are the people who work tirelessly in the local government units and national agencies and who continue todeliver social services amidst the pandemic.___13. Some unprincipled and dishonest people exploit and misuse relief measures of the government, particularlyduring times of crisis. We have seen how food grains meant for the poor have been misappropriated for profiteering. How,allegedly, PPE masks procured by the government failed to meet the required medical standards. And now we have theunscrupulous businessmen scampering for loans, taking advantage of a government policy. These wrongdoings must stop.___14. The Department of Health rolled out a series of town halls the day before the Sinovac vaccines arrived.The next complication was that just before the town halls commenced, there was an announcement that the arrivalof the Astra vaccine was also imminent, potentially as early as March 1. March 1 was also slated to be the first dayof the ceremonial vaccination rollout. This was communicated to the healthcare workers attending the townhalls, andit was made clear that they had a choice.___15. COVID-19 can spread quickly and widely. It has resulted in the deaths of over 1.9 million people worldwide andover 900 deaths in Australia. When enough people in the community are vaccinated, it slows down the spread of disease.Achieving herd immunity is a long-term goal. It usually requires a large amount of the population to be vaccinated. Studieswill monitor the impact of COVID-19 vaccines in Australia and whether herd immunity is developing over time.​</a>

"Until the COVID-19 vaccine is available, I will not allow the traditional face-to-face teaching or learning." He further added that "Life that is lost is lost forever. Education that is delayed can be recovered.
_______3. The universe is a complex system like a watch, Wo would not think that a watch can come about by accident. Something to complicated must have been created by someone. The universe is a lot more complicated, so it must have been created by a being who is a lot more intelligent.
_______4. The restaurant next to our school is a good place to go to have a good meal. My friends and I went there once, and we experienced the best service. The staff were all very polite and accommodating. The food is good with a reasonable price.
_______5. I know someone who smoked for decades, and it never produced any significant illness. Those claims about smoking are exaggerated!
_______6. We should not blame the media for deteriorating moral standards. Newspapers and TV are like weather reporters who report the facts. We do not blame weather reports for telling us that the weather is bad.
_______7. Child labor is work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential, and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development. In the Philippines. there are 2.1 million child laborer's aged 5 to 17 years old based on the 2011 Survey on Children of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). About 95 per cent of them are in hazardous work. Sixty-nine per cent of these an aged 15 to 17 years old, beyond the minimum allowable age for work but still exposed to hazardous work
_______8. Research shows that people who exercise regularly have better mental health and emotional wellbeing, and lower rates of mental illness. According to Philippine Mental Health Association, exercise improves mental health by reducing anxiety, depression, and negative mood and by improving self-esteem and cognitive function
_______9. Roses are the best flowers to express your love for someone. My grandfather had a massive rose garden, over 200 different species. Every Friday, he'd go out into the garden, clip a dozen, and make my grandmother a bouquet
_______10. Democracy does not work in a family. Parents should have the ultimate say because they are wiser and their children do not know what is best for themselves. Similarly the best form of government for a society is not a democratic one but one where the leaders are more like parents.</a>

 1. Naglunsad ang pamahalaan ng National Vaccination Day, pero labis akong naninindigan na may mga tao pa ring ayaw magpabakuna.
2. Kung ako ang tatanungin hayaan na lang sana ang taong bayan na magdesisyong sa isyung pagbabakuna.
3. Ang pagsunod sa health protocol ay sapat na kaya kung ako ang tatanungin maaaring hindi na tataas ang kaso ng Covid-19.
4. Sa aking pananaw, hindi makatarungan ang "no vaccine, no work" policy. 
5. Maraming mga kabataang edad 12-17 ang nagpabakuna, kaya sa tingin ko maaari nang magkaroon ng face to face classes sa susunod na pasukan.</a>

They continue to perform their responsibilities despite the high risk ofbeing exposed to the deadly coronavirus. Among the hundreds of frontliners waging war against the deadly coronavirus onour behalf are the people who work tirelessly in the local government units and national agencies and who continue todeliver social services amidst the pandemic.___13. Some unprincipled and dishonest people exploit and misuse relief measures of the government, particularlyduring times of crisis. We have seen how food grains meant for the poor have been misappropriated for profiteering. How,allegedly, PPE masks procured by the government failed to meet the required medical standards. And now we have theunscrupulous businessmen scampering for loans, taking advantage of a government policy. These wrongdoings must stop.___14. The Department of Health rolled out a series of town halls the day before the Sinovac vaccines arrived.The next complication was that just before the town halls commenced, there was an announcement that the arrivalof the Astra vaccine was also imminent, potentially as early as March 1. March 1 was also slated to be the first dayof the ceremonial vaccination rollout. This was communicated to the healthcare workers attending the townhalls, andit was made clear that they had a choice.___15. COVID-19 can spread quickly and widely. It has resulted in the deaths of over 1.9 million people worldwide andover 900 deaths in Australia. When enough people in the community are vaccinated, it slows down the spread of disease.Achieving herd immunity is a long-term goal. It usually requires a large amount of the population to be vaccinated. Studieswill monitor the impact of COVID-19 vaccines in Australia and whether herd immunity is developing over time.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Vaccines work by mimicking an infectious agent – viruses, bacteria or other microorganisms that can cause a disease. This ‘teaches’ our immune system to rapidly and effectively respond against it.<p></p>Traditionally, vaccines have done this by introducing a weakened form of an infectious agent that allows our immune system to build a memory of it. This way, our immune system can quickly recognize and fight it before it makes us ill. That’s how some of the COVID-19 vaccines have been designed.<p></p>Other COVID-19 vaccines have been developed using new approaches, which are called messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines. Instead of introducing antigens (a substance that causes your immune system to produce antibodies), mRNA vaccines give our body the genetic code it needs to allow our immune system to produce the antigen itself. mRNA vaccine technology has been studied for several decades. They contain no live virus and do not interfere with human DNA.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The strict lockdown measures led to economic contractions in Q2 that were unparalleled in modern times. However, the disparities between countries in the severity and duration of the social distancing measures imposed led to significant differences in GDP declines. For instance, in Germany or the US, where the mobility restrictions were relatively laxer (see first chart), the declines in GDP reached around 10% quarter-on-quarter (–9.7% for Germany and –9.1% for the US), while in countries that imposed stricter measures, such as Spain, the fall was substantially higher (–18.5%).</p><p></p><p>From the outset, infrastructure development has been a major priority of the Duterte administration, paving the way for the creation of its flagship Build Build Build program, wherein public spending on infrastructure projects is targeted to reach up to P9 trillion from 2017 to 2022.</p><p></p><p>COVID-19 has governments at all levels operating in a context of radical uncertainty. The regional and local impact of the COVID-19 crisis is highly heterogeneous, with significant implications for crisis management and policy responses. This paper takes an in-depth look at the territorial impact of the COVID-19 crisis in its different dimensions: health, economic, social and fiscal. It provides examples of responses by national and subnational governments to help mitigate the territorial effects of the crisis, and offers ten takeaways on managing COVID-19’s territorial impact. Finally, the paper offers a forward looking perspective to discuss the crisis’ implications for multi-level governance as well as points for policy-makers to consider as they build more resilient regions.</p><p></p><p>The private sector is the engine of growth. Successful businesses drive growth, create jobs and pay the taxes that finance services and investment. In developing countries, the private sector generates 90 per cent of jobs, funds 60 per cent of all investments and provides more than 80 per cent of government revenues.</p><p></p><p>While the rapid development of vaccines against COVID‑19 is an extraordinary achievement, successfully vaccinating the global population presents many challenges, from production to distribution, deployment, and importantly, acceptance. Trust in the vaccines is vital, and is critically dependant on the ability of governments to communicate the benefits of vaccination, and to deliver the vaccines safely and effectively. This brief addresses the role of governments in promoting confidence in the effectiveness and safety through effective communication, as well as trust in their ability to procure and distribute them efficiently and equitably. While only a small minority of the population holds strong anti-vaccination views, hesitancy about COVID‑19 vaccination is evident in many countries. Recognising that vaccination campaigns of the magnitude needed are unprecedented, government actions to garner trust will be essential to their success, and to the emergence of more resilient societies after the crisis.</p><p></p><p>The “social economy” has played an important role in addressing and mitigating the short- and long-term impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on economy and society. In the short term, social economy actors have assisted the recovery from the crisis by providing innovative solutions that are aimed at strengthening public services to complement government action. In the long term, social economy organisations can help reshape the post-crisis economy by promoting inclusive and sustainable economic models. Relying on decades of experience, its specific features and underlying principles, the social economy can inspire models of social innovation and a sense of purpose to firms operating in the market economy.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The mandatory wearing of facemask</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Wearing face masks is recommended as part of personal protective equipment and as a public health measure to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Their use, however, is deeply connected to social and cultural practices and has acquired a variety of personal and social meanings. This article aims to identify the diversity of sociocultural, ethical, and political meanings attributed to face masks, how they might impact public health policies, and how they should be considered in health communication. In May 2020, we involved 29 experts of an interdisciplinary research network on health and society to provide their testimonies on the use of face masks in 20 European and 2 Asian countries (China and South Korea). They reflected on regulations in the corresponding jurisdictions as well as the personal and social aspects of face mask wearing. We analyzed those testimonies thematically, employing the method of qualitative descriptive analysis. The analysis framed the four dimensions of the societal and personal practices of wearing (or not wearing) face masks: individual perceptions of infection risk, personal interpretations of responsibility and solidarity, cultural traditions and religious imprinting, and the need of expressing self-identity. Our study points to the importance for an in-depth understanding of the cultural and sociopolitical considerations around the personal and social meaning of mask wearing in different contexts as a necessary prerequisite for the assessment of the effectiveness of face masks as a public health measure. Improving the personal and collective understanding of citizens' behaviors and attitudes appears essential for designing more effective health communications about COVID-19 pandemic or other global crises in the future.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I would feel great !</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Knowing that vaccines are given by the government and are a protocol to follow safety guidelines such as the vaccine ensures that the environment I am working in is slightly safer than compared to working without my co-workers having the vaccine, that is because the vaccine contains antibody-producing memory cells are created when the body's first reaction to antigen results in the production of antibodies. These cells continue to exist after the pathogen is killed by the antibodies. When the body is exposed to the same disease more than once, the antibody response is faster and more powerful than the first time, since memory cells are ready to pump out antibodies against that antigen. This implies that if the individual is ever exposed to the hazardous virus again, their immune system will be ready to fight back and keep them safe from sickness.</p><p></p><br />
