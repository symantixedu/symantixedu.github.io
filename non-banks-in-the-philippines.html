But there are good chances that the country can bounce back in the next two years, according to the World Bank's latest Philippines Economic Update, released today The eruption of Taal Volcano and, most importantly, the global outbreak of Covid-19 including the strict containment measures against the pandemic have led to severe disruptions in manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, construction, and trade, according to the report, titled Braving the New Normal Affecting millions of households nationwide as well as overseas Filipinos, the cumulative impact of these events on the economy has been broad-based, steep, and deep, halting investment activity, and leading to the lowest consumption growth in three decades. Private consumption growth fell to 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2020 from 6.2 percent last year. The hotel and restaurant industry suffered the most, contracting by 15.4 percent             The economic contraction in 2020 will likely cause an increase in poverty. Containment measures have cut off income streams from seasonal wage earners and those engaged in entrepreneurial activities in non agricultural activities and low-end service jobs, which were the drivers of poverty reduction in recent years​</a>

Then write a reflection related to the discipline and practice of Social Work on the space provided below the box 5-7 sentences (20pts) Philippines: Social Assistance to Poor Households, Support for Small Enterprises Key to Broad- Based Recovery, David Llorito (June 9, 2020) Hammered by natural disasters and the Covid-19 pandemic, the Philippine economy is projected to contract by 1.9 percent in 2020. But there are good chances that the country can bounce back in the next two years, according to the World Bank's latest Philippines Economic Update, released today The eruption of Taal Volcano and, most importantly, the global outbreak of Covid-19 including the strict containment measures against the pandemic have led to severe disruptions in manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, construction, and trade, according to the report, titled Braving the New Normal Affecting millions of households nationwide as well as overseas Filipinos, the cumulative impact of these events on the economy has been broad-based, steep, and deep, halting investment activity, and leading to the lowest consumption growth in three decades. Private consumption growth fell to 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2020 from 6.2 percent last year. The hotel and restaurant industry suffered the most, contracting by 15.4 percent             The economic contraction in 2020 will likely cause an increase in poverty. Containment measures have cut off income streams from seasonal wage earners and those engaged in entrepreneurial activities in non agricultural activities and low-end service jobs, which were the drivers of poverty reduction in recent years​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a Social Work assistant, it is important to be aware of the current economic situation in the Philippines, especially with the projected increase in poverty due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It is essential to understand the impact of poverty on households and overseas Filipinos, and how it affects different industries, such as manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, construction, and trade. As we continue to provide social assistance to poor households, it is important to consider supporting small enterprises to aid in the country's economic recovery. As Social Work assistants, we can help by advocating for policies and programs that address poverty and promote economic growth in the Philippines.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS :-)</p><br />
