                                            TITLE-The Five Essential Elements of a Story
CHARACTERS: The characters are the individuals that the story is about.The author should introduce the characters in the story with enough information that the reader can visualize each person. This is achieved by providing detailed descriptions of a character’s physical attributes and personality traits. Every story should have a main character. The main character determines the way the plot will
develop and is usually who will solve the problem the story centers upon. However, the other characters are also very important because they supply additional details, explanations, or actions. All characters should stay true to the author’s descriptions throughout the story so that the reader can understand and believe the action that is taking place—and perhaps even predict which character may do what next.
SETTING: The setting is the location of the action. An author should describe the
environment or surroundings of the story in such detail that the reader feels that he
or she can picture the scene. Unusual settings (such as a fantasy world) can be
interesting, but everyday settings can help a reader to better visualize the story and
feel connected to the plot!
PLOT: The plot is the actual story around which the entire book is based. A plot should have a very clear beginning, middle, and end—with all the necessary descriptions and suspense, called exposition—so that the reader can make sense of the action and follow along from start to finish.
CONFLICT: Every story has a conflict to solve. The plot is centered on this conflict and the ways in which the characters attempt to resolve the problem. When the story’s action becomes most exciting, right before the resolution, it is called the climax.
RESOLUTION: The solution to the problem is the way the action is resolved. For
example, Katie often resolves a conflict by finding a compromise for two fighting
characters or helping fix any mistakes she made while switcherooed into someone else.It is important that the resolution fit the rest of the story in tone and creativity and
solve all parts of the conflict.
Guide Questions:
1. Who are the main and supporting characters in the story?
2. When and where did the story take place? Which part of the story reveals the conflict?
3. Why did the judge dismiss the case?
4. What lesson did you learn from the two fathers in the story?
5. Which part of the story shows event that could happen in real life? Why?
6. In the story, what realization in life did you have?</a>

                                            The art that we perceive through our eyes is called the visual art and architecture is one part of it. Visual arts involve not only painting and sculpture, but include such things as clothes, household appliances, and the furnishing of our homes, schools, churches, and other buildings. Out of the many common things we use in our daily lives, we can derive real pleasure. The aesthetic aspects of any work--a painting, a song, story, dance or play-are what make it art. Aesthetics refer to the forms and psychological effects of arts. Another form of the more important Arts is music. This is the art of combining and regulating sounds of varying pitch to produce compositions, ezoressing various ideas, and emotions.It's primary function is to entertain. Music is one of the great arts of civization,along with literate, painting, sculpture, architecture and dance. As an art, it bases its appeal on the sensuous beauty of musical sounds. Dance-is another form of art that is common to man even during the earliest times. It is the most direct of the arts for it makes use of the human body as its medium. It springs from our love for expressive gestures, release of tension through rhythmic movement. Dance heightens the pleasure of being, and at the sane time, mirrors the life of society. Moreover, the are of the theatre or drama is another of the important arts. Dramatic activities are usually part of every school &amp; community program. Classes dramatize the events they're studying, clubs or organisations and institutions stage plays. Going to the theatre to see a play is a wonderful experience. Play may e a comedy, tragedy, or mystery ,musical or melodrama. The motion picture--Popular addition to the various forms of the theatre. Through it, a lot of people are able to see dramatic performances everyday. Theatrical productions, including motion pictures &amp; television, combine art forms. In addition, the play itself is a form of literature. The opera, for example is a drama set to music. It is also necessary that we distinguish between art and nature for they are fundamentally different. We maybe impressed by the majestic cone of May on volcano, the awesome beauty of the sunset on Manila Bay, thus, react to the wonders of nature. No matter how close art is to nature, art akwats shows that its man- made. It is an interpretation of nature and life. ARTIST- An artist is a person who exhibits exceptional skills in design, drawing, painting, etc.or one who works in one of the performing arts, like an actor or musician. There are two kinds of artists--creactors and perfirmers. Example :A composer writes a song to be sung by talented singers. A dramatist of plagwright writes a play to be staged lby a company of actors. A choreographer composes a ballet or dance sequence which will be performed by a troupe of dancers. Music, theatre, and dance are performing arts. Besides the creator, they require other artists who recreate what has been composed. Thus, performers are important.The Work of thd Creative Artist - Creativity is an artist's trait developed in the course of her life to solve problems or express her feelings. Her continuing  reaction to emerging conditions of nature and social life gives birth to new ideas and new methods. These in turn, she uses to overcome difficulties which in the process of confrontation with reality give the solution to a vision, create art, or activate social transformation. The process of Creation-there are three major phrases in the process of Creation. First, the artist must have an idea, second, he must have a material to work on, and  third, he must give form to his idea. *The Idea - Artists are highly sensitive persons specially aware of the things that surround them. They notice the sound, color, and movements of people and things. Art expression is usually based on the so - called higher senses of sight &amp; sound. *The Material and Process-The second phrase of  creation in art concerns the material which the artist uses to give form to his idea. Example, a painter uses pigments a sculptor uses stone, metal, or wood, an architect various  building materials. An author uses words, a composer musical sounds which are the materials for his creations. *Organization and Form-The third phrase in creating is organizing the idea and giving it form in the selected material.Artists have developed a host of different forms to express the ideas they work on. Question :How are you going to differentiate arts from nature. 2.State your reason why art is man-made. 3.How is art related to humanities? ​</a>

They may be just around us, around the corner-mom, dad, sister, brother, a classmate or classmates, a street cleaner, security guard. But, who do you call your true friends? What traits do they have? First, true friends are honest. They give you a truthful picture of who they are and how they react in different situations. When things do not seem right, they let you know. True friends make you happy, especially when you share the same interests. They make things light to take. Good friends are good listeners and they notice how little, day-to-day things can affect you. They can usually tell when you're happy, sad, excited, shocked, or upset. Real friends are supportive of your goals. They help you become the person you want to be. They do not put you in danger. They are loyal, sticking with you through good times and bad. They, too, accept you and your faults, and they are patient with your mistakes until things become better. True friendship is rare, but finding it is just like finding a treasure of love-a love that is to be nurtured and taken care of like a garden.​</a>

                            5. TITLE-The Five Essential Elements of a Story
CHARACTERS: The characters are the individuals that the story is about.The author should introduce the characters in the story with enough information that the reader can visualize each person. This is achieved by providing detailed descriptions of a character’s physical attributes and personality traits. Every story should have a main character. The main character determines the way the plot will
develop and is usually who will solve the problem the story centers upon. However, the other characters are also very important because they supply additional details, explanations, or actions. All characters should stay true to the author’s descriptions throughout the story so that the reader can understand and believe the action that is taking place—and perhaps even predict which character may do what next.
SETTING: The setting is the location of the action. An author should describe the
environment or surroundings of the story in such detail that the reader feels that he
or she can picture the scene. Unusual settings (such as a fantasy world) can be
interesting, but everyday settings can help a reader to better visualize the story and
feel connected to the plot!
PLOT: The plot is the actual story around which the entire book is based. A plot should have a very clear beginning, middle, and end—with all the necessary descriptions and suspense, called exposition—so that the reader can make sense of the action and follow along from start to finish.
CONFLICT: Every story has a conflict to solve. The plot is centered on this conflict and the ways in which the characters attempt to resolve the problem. When the story’s action becomes most exciting, right before the resolution, it is called the climax.
RESOLUTION: The solution to the problem is the way the action is resolved. For
example, Katie often resolves a conflict by finding a compromise for two fighting
characters or helping fix any mistakes she made while switcherooed into someone else.It is important that the resolution fit the rest of the story in tone and creativity and
solve all parts of the conflict.
Guide Questions:
1. Who are the main and supporting characters in the story?
2. When and where did the story take place? Which part of the story reveals the conflict?
3. Why did the judge dismiss the case?
4. What lesson did you learn from the two fathers in the story?
5. Which part of the story shows event that could happen in real life? Why?
6. In the story, what realization in life did you have?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A mystery is a story that has five basic but important elements. These five components are: the characters, the setting, the plot, the problem, and the solution. ... The author should introduce the characters in the story with enough information that the reader can visualize each person.</p><br />

                            9. The art that we perceive through our eyes is called the visual art and architecture is one part of it. Visual arts involve not only painting and sculpture, but include such things as clothes, household appliances, and the furnishing of our homes, schools, churches, and other buildings. Out of the many common things we use in our daily lives, we can derive real pleasure. The aesthetic aspects of any work--a painting, a song, story, dance or play-are what make it art. Aesthetics refer to the forms and psychological effects of arts. Another form of the more important Arts is music. This is the art of combining and regulating sounds of varying pitch to produce compositions, ezoressing various ideas, and emotions.It's primary function is to entertain. Music is one of the great arts of civization,along with literate, painting, sculpture, architecture and dance. As an art, it bases its appeal on the sensuous beauty of musical sounds. Dance-is another form of art that is common to man even during the earliest times. It is the most direct of the arts for it makes use of the human body as its medium. It springs from our love for expressive gestures, release of tension through rhythmic movement. Dance heightens the pleasure of being, and at the sane time, mirrors the life of society. Moreover, the are of the theatre or drama is another of the important arts. Dramatic activities are usually part of every school &amp; community program. Classes dramatize the events they're studying, clubs or organisations and institutions stage plays. Going to the theatre to see a play is a wonderful experience. Play may e a comedy, tragedy, or mystery ,musical or melodrama. The motion picture--Popular addition to the various forms of the theatre. Through it, a lot of people are able to see dramatic performances everyday. Theatrical productions, including motion pictures &amp; television, combine art forms. In addition, the play itself is a form of literature. The opera, for example is a drama set to music. It is also necessary that we distinguish between art and nature for they are fundamentally different. We maybe impressed by the majestic cone of May on volcano, the awesome beauty of the sunset on Manila Bay, thus, react to the wonders of nature. No matter how close art is to nature, art akwats shows that its man- made. It is an interpretation of nature and life. ARTIST- An artist is a person who exhibits exceptional skills in design, drawing, painting, etc.or one who works in one of the performing arts, like an actor or musician. There are two kinds of artists--creactors and perfirmers. Example :A composer writes a song to be sung by talented singers. A dramatist of plagwright writes a play to be staged lby a company of actors. A choreographer composes a ballet or dance sequence which will be performed by a troupe of dancers. Music, theatre, and dance are performing arts. Besides the creator, they require other artists who recreate what has been composed. Thus, performers are important.The Work of thd Creative Artist - Creativity is an artist's trait developed in the course of her life to solve problems or express her feelings. Her continuing  reaction to emerging conditions of nature and social life gives birth to new ideas and new methods. These in turn, she uses to overcome difficulties which in the process of confrontation with reality give the solution to a vision, create art, or activate social transformation. The process of Creation-there are three major phrases in the process of Creation. First, the artist must have an idea, second, he must have a material to work on, and  third, he must give form to his idea. *The Idea - Artists are highly sensitive persons specially aware of the things that surround them. They notice the sound, color, and movements of people and things. Art expression is usually based on the so - called higher senses of sight &amp; sound. *The Material and Process-The second phrase of  creation in art concerns the material which the artist uses to give form to his idea. Example, a painter uses pigments a sculptor uses stone, metal, or wood, an architect various  building materials.

They may be just around us, around the corner-mom, dad, sister, brother, a classmate or classmates, a street cleaner, security guard. But, who do you call your true friends? What traits do they have? First, true friends are honest. They give you a truthful picture of who they are and how they react in different situations. When things do not seem right, they let you know. True friends make you happy, especially when you share the same interests. They make things light to take. Good friends are good listeners and they notice how little, day-to-day things can affect you. They can usually tell when you're happy, sad, excited, shocked, or upset. Real friends are supportive of your goals. They help you become the person you want to be. They do not put you in danger. They are loyal, sticking with you through good times and bad. They, too, accept you and your faults, and they are patient with your mistakes until things become better. True friendship is rare, but finding it is just like finding a treasure of love-a love that is to be nurtured and taken care of like a garden.​</h2><br />
