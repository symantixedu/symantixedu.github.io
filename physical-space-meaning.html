Physical properties are those that can be observed without changing the make-up, or identity of the matter. For example, clay is malleable, which means it will bend or flatten when . squeezed. Squeezing, changes the shape of the clay but does not change what the clay is made of. Chemical properties describe matter based on its ability to change into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, paper is flammable: it is capable of burning in the presence of oxygen. 6. How does the paragraph begin? A. It begins with a definition of matter. B.

Physical properties are those that can be observed without changing the make-up, or identity of the matter. For example, clay is malleable, which means it will bend or flatten when . squeezed. Squeezing, changes the shape of the clay but does not change what the clay is made of.
