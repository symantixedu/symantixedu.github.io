                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Afrikaans literature</p><p>South Africa was colonized by Europeans against the resistance of Africans and was for some time afterward a battlefield between Briton and Boer. Although South Africa became independent in 1910, the nation’s varied ethnic constituents have not yet been unified in a harmonious whole, and the tension arising from the unequal relations between blacks and whites is the authentic note of much South African literature. Indigenous South African literature effectively began in the late 19th century and became fairly copious in the 20th century. Much of the work by persons born in South Africa was limited in its viewpoint; often these writers only dimly apprehended the aspirations, perceptions, and traditions of South Africans belonging to a people other than their own. English-speaking South African writers are mainly urban and cosmopolitan; their culture is English, and they often have a wider audience among English-speaking communities abroad. By contrast, Afrikaans writers belonged for many decades to a close-knit community—born of a defensive posture—with shared experiences (including rural roots), shared aspirations and religion, and a strong sense of nationhood. Only in the 1960s did a major break with this tradition become apparent.</p><p></p><p>The twin 20th-century phenomena of urbanization and apartheid greatly affected the psychological makeup and thus the literary expression of English- and Afrikaans-speaking whites, as well as of indigenous Africans. The moral and artistic challenges inherent in South Africa’s situation stimulated writing up to a point, but the South African preoccupation with “race” problems may ultimately have proven inimical to the creation of an authentic national literature</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>follow naman jan o</p><br />
