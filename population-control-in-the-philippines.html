                                            The Philippines (/ˈfɪlɪpiːnz/ (About this soundlisten); Filipino: Pilipinas),[13] officially the Republic of the Philippines (Filipino: Republika ng Pilipinas),[d] is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia. It is situated in the western Pacific Ocean, and consists of about 7,640 islands, that are broadly categorized under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The Philippines is bounded by the South China Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to the east, and the Celebes Sea to the southwest, and shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Japan to the northeast, Palau to the east and southeast, Indonesia to the south, Malaysia and Brunei to the southwest, Vietnam to the west, and China to the northwest. The Philippines covers an area of 300,000 km2 (120,000 sq mi) and, as of 2020, had a population of around 109 million people, making it the world's twelfth-most populous country. The Philippines is a multinational state, with diverse ethnicities and cultures throughout its islands. Manila is the nation's capital, while the largest city is Quezon City, both lying within the urban area of Metro Manila.
Negritos, some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples. Adoption of Animism, Hinduism and Islam established island-kingdoms called Kedatuans, Rajahnates and Sultanates. The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer leading a fleet for Spain, marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain. Spanish settlement through Mexico, beginning in 1565, led to the Philippines becoming part of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years. During this time, Catholicism became the dominant religion, and Manila became the western hub of trans-Pacific trade. In 1896, the Philippine Revolution began, which then became entwined with the 1898 Spanish–American War. Spain ceded the territory to the United States, while Filipino rebels declared the First Philippine Republic. The ensuing Philippine–American War ended with the United States establishing control over the territory, which they maintained until the Japanese invasion of the islands during World War II. Following liberation, the Philippines became independent in 1946. Since then, the unitary sovereign state has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by the People Power Revolution.
It is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country, which has an economy transitioning from being based on agriculture to being based more on services and manufacturing. The Philippines is a founding member of the United Nations, World Trade Organization, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the East Asia Summit. The Philippines' position as an island country on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the country prone to earthquakes and typhoons. The country has a variety of natural resources and a globally significant level of biodiversity. This low-lying island geography makes the country vulnerable to climate change, increasing risk from typhoons and sea level rise.</a>

This study examined the relationship of book and e-book, this paper tends to identify in 1 affects reading comprehension. Three out of ten students in the Philippines are more hooked to reading materials published online. This paper's objectives aim to find the centre problem of the respondents when it comes to understanding complex material. 2. The physical "brick and mortar" classroom is starting to lose its monopoly as the place of learning. The Internet has made online learning possible, and many researchers and educators are interested in online learning to enhance and improve student learning outcomes while combating the reduction in resources, particularly in higher education. It is only three percent of the population worldwide compared to traditional face-to-face format and the factors that influence the effectiveness of online courses. This study examines the evidence of the effectiveness of online learning by organizing and summarizing the findings and challenges of online learning into positive, negative, mixed, and null findings. 3. The purpose of this study was comparing effectiveness of methods of presentation of concept maps and methods of concept mapping on reading comprehension. The subjects of this study consisted of sixty-six third-year high school students (thirty-three female, thirty-three male), that were selected randomly by multistage sampling method. Participants were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and 1 control group. The research instruments were: 1) experimental texts, 2) comprehension test, and 3) Camp Tools software, and 4) Teacher-generated concept maps. Treatment groups included computer-based concept mapping, paper-pencils concept mapping, and reading text with prepared concept maps. The control group for the study did not receive any concept map. The results of this study indicated that presentation of per-prepared concept maps significantly improved comprehension, compared to the map generation and control group. But paper- pencil and computer-based concept mapping compared to the control groups were not statistically significant. The best way for use of concept maps is teacher-generated concept maps with texts.pahelp plesss ​</a>

                                            what are some ways on how we can be able to lessen the rate of population growth in the philippines?
1. Empower women
Studies show that women with access to reproductive health services find it easier to break out of poverty, while those who work are more likely to use birth control. The United Nations Population Fund aims to tackle both issues at once, running microcredit projects to turn young women into advocates for reproductive health.
2. Promote family planning
Simply educating men and women about contraception can have a big impact. When Iran introduced a national family planning programme in 1989, its fertility rate fell from 5.6 births per woman to 2.6 in a decade. A similar effort in Rwanda saw a threefold increase in contraception usage in just five years.
3. Make education entertaining
The US-based Population Media Center gets creative to reach women. Its radio soap operas, which feature culturally specific stories about reproductive issues, have been heard by as many as 500 million people in 50 countries. In Ethiopia, 63 per cent of women seeking reproductive health services reported tuning in.
4. Government incentives
Those at UK charity Population Matters believe there should be a senior government official responsible for addressing population-related issues. They urge governments to promote “responsible parenthood” and say subsidies should be limited to the first two children unless the family is living in poverty.
5) One-child legislation
During China’s high controversial one-child policy, fertility fell from six births per woman in the 1960s to 1.5 in 2014. However, Amnesty International reports that the policy led to coerced or forced abortions and sterilisations. It also disrupted traditional support structures for the elderly and led to a gender imbalance.</a>

                                            1. A sudden increase in mice population happened when all the snakes that feed on them were eliminated by the farmers.2. Polar bears are common species in the polar regions which feed on fishes. Due to melting of polar caps, polar bears lost their habitats causing the decrease in their population and might eventually lead to total vanishment of their kind. As a result of this possible occurrence, a gradual increase in the population of fishes might happen.3. Water hyacinth is a native species from subtropical South America that was introduced to the Philippines. This plant species can rise above the surface of the water which prevents the sunlight from penetrating the water. As a result, the population of other plant species living under water decreases.4. A typical grassland were small mammals and insects thrive was converted into an area where sheep are domesticated and bred. As a result, the sheep feed on the grass competing with other small mammals. This might lead to the decrease in population of grasses which are the producers and increase in the population of animals that feed on them. Hence, an imbalance in the ecosystem might occur.5. In 1949, five cats were brought to Marion Island, a part of South Africa in the southern Indian Ocean. The cats were introduced as pest control for mice. This result to the sudden decrease in the population of mice.​</a>

                            9. The Philippines (/ˈfɪlɪpiːnz/ (About this soundlisten); Filipino: Pilipinas),[13] officially the Republic of the Philippines (Filipino: Republika ng Pilipinas),[d] is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia. It is situated in the western Pacific Ocean, and consists of about 7,640 islands, that are broadly categorized under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The Philippines is bounded by the South China Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to the east, and the Celebes Sea to the southwest, and shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Japan to the northeast, Palau to the east and southeast, Indonesia to the south, Malaysia and Brunei to the southwest, Vietnam to the west, and China to the northwest. The Philippines covers an area of 300,000 km2 (120,000 sq mi) and, as of 2020, had a population of around 109 million people, making it the world's twelfth-most populous country. The Philippines is a multinational state, with diverse ethnicities and cultures throughout its islands. Manila is the nation's capital, while the largest city is Quezon City, both lying within the urban area of Metro Manila.
Negritos, some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples. Adoption of Animism, Hinduism and Islam established island-kingdoms called Kedatuans, Rajahnates and Sultanates. The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer leading a fleet for Spain, marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain. Spanish settlement through Mexico, beginning in 1565, led to the Philippines becoming part of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years. During this time, Catholicism became the dominant religion, and Manila became the western hub of trans-Pacific trade. In 1896, the Philippine Revolution began, which then became entwined with the 1898 Spanish–American War. Spain ceded the territory to the United States, while Filipino rebels declared the First Philippine Republic. The ensuing Philippine–American War ended with the United States establishing control over the territory, which they maintained until the Japanese invasion of the islands during World War II. Following liberation, the Philippines became independent in 1946. Since then, the unitary sovereign state has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by the People Power Revolution.
It is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country, which has an economy transitioning from being based on agriculture to being based more on services and manufacturing. The Philippines is a founding member of the United Nations, World Trade Organization, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the East Asia Summit. The Philippines' position as an island country on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the country prone to earthquakes and typhoons. The country has a variety of natural resources and a globally significant level of biodiversity. This low-lying island geography makes the country vulnerable to climate change, increasing risk from typhoons and sea level rise.</h2><br />

Three out of ten students in the Philippines are more hooked to reading materials published online. This paper's objectives aim to find the centre problem of the respondents when it comes to understanding complex material. 2. The physical "brick and mortar" classroom is starting to lose its monopoly as the place of learning. The Internet has made online learning possible, and many researchers and educators are interested in online learning to enhance and improve student learning outcomes while combating the reduction in resources, particularly in higher education. It is only three percent of the population worldwide compared to traditional face-to-face format and the factors that influence the effectiveness of online courses. This study examines the evidence of the effectiveness of online learning by organizing and summarizing the findings and challenges of online learning into positive, negative, mixed, and null findings. 3. The purpose of this study was comparing effectiveness of methods of presentation of concept maps and methods of concept mapping on reading comprehension. The subjects of this study consisted of sixty-six third-year high school students (thirty-three female, thirty-three male), that were selected randomly by multistage sampling method. Participants were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and 1 control group. The research instruments were: 1) experimental texts, 2) comprehension test, and 3) Camp Tools software, and 4) Teacher-generated concept maps. Treatment groups included computer-based concept mapping, paper-pencils concept mapping, and reading text with prepared concept maps. The control group for the study did not receive any concept map. The results of this study indicated that presentation of per-prepared concept maps significantly improved comprehension, compared to the map generation and control group. But paper- pencil and computer-based concept mapping compared to the control groups were not statistically significant. The best way for use of concept maps is teacher-generated concept maps with texts.pahelp plesss ​</h2><br />

                            19. what are some ways on how we can be able to lessen the rate of population growth in the philippines?
1. Empower women
Studies show that women with access to reproductive health services find it easier to break out of poverty, while those who work are more likely to use birth control. The United Nations Population Fund aims to tackle both issues at once, running microcredit projects to turn young women into advocates for reproductive health.
2. Promote family planning
Simply educating men and women about contraception can have a big impact. When Iran introduced a national family planning programme in 1989, its fertility rate fell from 5.6 births per woman to 2.6 in a decade. A similar effort in Rwanda saw a threefold increase in contraception usage in just five years.
3. Make education entertaining
The US-based Population Media Center gets creative to reach women. Its radio soap operas, which feature culturally specific stories about reproductive issues, have been heard by as many as 500 million people in 50 countries. In Ethiopia, 63 per cent of women seeking reproductive health services reported tuning in.
4. Government incentives
Those at UK charity Population Matters believe there should be a senior government official responsible for addressing population-related issues. They urge governments to promote “responsible parenthood” and say subsidies should be limited to the first two children unless the family is living in poverty.
5) One-child legislation
During China’s high controversial one-child policy, fertility fell from six births per woman in the 1960s to 1.5 in 2014. However, Amnesty International reports that the policy led to coerced or forced abortions and sterilisations. It also disrupted traditional support structures for the elderly and led to a gender imbalance.</h2><br />

                            21. 1. A sudden increase in mice population happened when all the snakes that feed on them were eliminated by the farmers.2. Polar bears are common species in the polar regions which feed on fishes. Due to melting of polar caps, polar bears lost their habitats causing the decrease in their population and might eventually lead to total vanishment of their kind. As a result of this possible occurrence, a gradual increase in the population of fishes might happen.3. Water hyacinth is a native species from subtropical South America that was introduced to the Philippines. This plant species can rise above the surface of the water which prevents the sunlight from penetrating the water. As a result, the population of other plant species living under water decreases.4. A typical grassland were small mammals and insects thrive was converted into an area where sheep are domesticated and bred. As a result, the sheep feed on the grass competing with other small mammals. This might lead to the decrease in population of grasses which are the producers and increase in the population of animals that feed on them. Hence, an imbalance in the ecosystem might occur.5. In 1949, five cats were brought to Marion Island, a part of South Africa in the southern Indian Ocean. The cats were introduced as pest control for mice. This result to the sudden decrease in the population of mice.​</h2><br />

                        Catholic Church's policies  in Population Control and Growth<p></p><p>1. <strong>Find news articles that discuss the Catholic Church's policies</strong> in the Philippines, notably in relation to its role in population control and growth.</p>A review of initiatives promoted or directed by the Catholic church in response to the Philippines' population issue. These initiatives are motivated by the Church's conviction that social and economic justice should come first and that population expansion is connected to development in general. The Catholic Church in the Philippines, to whom 85% of the population belongs, sees it as a problem primarily involving the care of individuals, and instead of focusing on external contraceptive control, it concentrates its efforts on internal human sexual control. In the 1960s, the church started a curriculum called Family Life Education.<p></p><p>2. <strong>Based on the news reports gathered, explain your position</strong> on the Catholic Church's contribution to reproductive health and the population increase in the Philippines.</p><p></p>The majority-Catholic nation also boasts one of Asia's fastest-growing populations and a sizable amount of chronic poverty. The Philippines has lagged behind as its neighbors have progressed faster.The church disagrees with economists who claim that rapid population expansion is a major contributing element. It asserts that people need work, not contraceptives, and that population growth is not a contributing factor to poverty.<p>3. <strong>Describe one key insight you have gained from this class.</strong></p><p></p>Only if fertility rates decline in a way that causes the young-age population to expand more slowly than the total workforce will the demographic window become available. Due to the Catholic hierarchy's extreme stance, the state is unable to address the problem effectively.<p></p><p></p><p>4. <strong>Think about how the following will benefit from your newfound knowledge:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>a. your nation</strong></p>Our government must address the issue of reproductive health, and we must all work together to support our nation in doing so. We must completely abide by the law if we want to protect ourselves.<p></p><p><strong>b. your neighborhood</strong></p>By protecting ourselves with contraceptives, attending family planning classes, and taking care of other associated reproductive health issues, we should also support our barangay.<p></p><p><strong>c. your school</strong></p>We should be familiar with the fundamental facts about population increase, sexual health, and the many viewpoints and ideologies of the teachers and students in our school.<p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>d. one's family</strong></p>Parents that are well-informed can do a lot for their kids. We can stop overpopulation and poverty if both the mother and father are educated.
