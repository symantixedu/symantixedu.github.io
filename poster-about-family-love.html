The man kicked and threw the poor cat out of his house. __ 4. There was plenty of food, and the music was playing. Everybody was having a good time. __ 5. He approached the task with sheer determination. He had studied his plans carefully, spent hours preparing and was sure of his approach. The hours he spent practicing were grueling and exhausting but he was ready. This was the year he would win the poster-making contest at school. __ 6. The night it happened was one we will never forget. The wind was screeching outside as rain pounded against the window. We had lost electricity hours ago and had nothing but candles to light the house. The battery powered radio we had was broadcasting a warning to lock your doors and stay inside. __ 7. The gym of the high school was brightly decorated. The red and white streamers covered the walls and heart shapes were scattered all over the floor. Red glitter was thrown on all the tables and love songs were playing in the background. The Valentine’s dance was about to begin.  __ 8. The door swings open to reveal a Christmas tree, alone in the middle of the room, sparkling with hundreds of lights. Silence greets me as I glance around the room. The fireplace is empty and the snowstorm howls outside the window. My family has gone and I am left alone with my thoughts.  __ 9. Lola sat on the old, lumpy couch crying. She could let it all out here, alone in her mother’s small, quiet apartment. The familiar walls were covered in rose pink wallpaper. Goldie, her mother’s eleventh fish, seemed to stare sympathetically at Lola through the fishbowl sitting on the counter. The smell of her mother’s vanilla candles comforted her aching heart. __  10.  There  is  no  one That  can  be  better Because  you  are  brilliant. There  is  nothing That  you  cannot  you  do Because  you  are  unbeatabl e. There  is  no  place That  you  cannot  go There  is  no  person Because  you  are  always  welcomed. That  can  hold  you  back Because  you  are  unstoppable​</a>

The man kicked and threw the poor cat out of his house. __ 4. There was plenty of food, and the music was playing. Everybody was having a good time. __ 5. He approached the task with sheer determination. He had studied his plans carefully, spent hours preparing and was sure of his approach. The hours he spent practicing were grueling and exhausting but he was ready. This was the year he would win the poster-making contest at school. __ 6. The night it happened was one we will never forget. The wind was screeching outside as rain pounded against the window. We had lost electricity hours ago and had nothing but candles to light the house. The battery powered radio we had was broadcasting a warning to lock your doors and stay inside. __ 7. The gym of the high school was brightly decorated. The red and white streamers covered the walls and heart shapes were scattered all over the floor. Red glitter was thrown on all the tables and love songs were playing in the background. The Valentine’s dance was about to begin.  __ 8. The door swings open to reveal a Christmas tree, alone in the middle of the room, sparkling with hundreds of lights. Silence greets me as I glance around the room. The fireplace is empty and the snowstorm howls outside the window. My family has gone and I am left alone with my thoughts.  __ 9. Lola sat on the old, lumpy couch crying. She could let it all out here, alone in her mother’s small, quiet apartment. The familiar walls were covered in rose pink wallpaper. Goldie, her mother’s eleventh fish, seemed to stare sympathetically at Lola through the fishbowl sitting on the counter. The smell of her mother’s vanilla candles comforted her aching heart. __  10.  There  is  no  one That  can  be  better Because  you  are  brilliant. There  is  nothing That  you  cannot  you  do Because  you  are  unbeatabl e. There  is  no  place That  you  cannot  go There  is  no  person Because  you  are  always  welcomed. That  can  hold  you  back Because  you  are  unstoppable​</h2><br />
