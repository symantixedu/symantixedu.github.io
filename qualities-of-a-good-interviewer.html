                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Hey hope these helps</p><p>Interviewing is a crucial part of the recruiting process. To be a good interviewer, you have to be prepared, ask the right questions, listen carefully, and evaluate the candidate to see if they're the right fit for your company.</p><p></p><p>Special Offer</p><p>It's important to prepare thoroughly before interviewing a potential employee so that you don't come across as disorganized and unprofessional. Be sure to brush up on the interviewee's skills and employment history beforehand by reading their resume, and print out a copy for reference during the interview.</p><p></p><p>Create a list of questions that are tailored to the role you are hiring for, such as questions relating to skills, job knowledge, and work history. You should also include behavioral and situational questions to give you a good idea of how the candidate handles challenging situations. Preparing a list will also ensure that you ask each candidate similar questions.An unstructured interview can cause you to lose track of the interview and end up wasting your and the candidate's time. The best way to avoid this is to set out a structure during your interview prep.</p><p></p><p>For example, make the first part of the interview a brief introduction and description of the main goals of the position and what your company hopes to achieve, followed by the interview questions. Lastly, give the interviewee an opportunity to ask a few questions of their own.</p><p></p><p>Notetaking is essential in any interview. It will help you keep track of how each candidate performed and allow you to compare candidates once the interview stage is over. Be sure to clear your mind and focus on what the candidate says so that you can note any positive or negative attributes. You might also want to use a scorecard to assess the candidate's answers effectively.</p><br />
