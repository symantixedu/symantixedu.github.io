Be able to look for at least five (5) opinions andthe words that signal them.I went home late at night and pondered on things. My nerve muscles were in pain. It was a big day forme.Eight (8) hours was not enough that I rendered additional two (2) to finish my task as office assistant.After I had introduced myself to the team, no one bothered to throw a 'hi' on me. The department head orientedme in her office for half an hour and instructed me to go to my workstation. Puzzled, I went to the wrongdepartment. The struggle was there when I had no one to talk to; I assumed nobody would like to befriend me.They were all busy with their urgent tasks. All of them were office staff and I alone was their newly hiredassistantI happened to ask and meet Mrs. Gracias, the team leader whom I preferred to talk to than myofficemates. She clearly discussed to me what to accomplish from time to time.I felt that my not so friendly workmates were keeping an eye on me.I believe I've had enough of the wrong work system this morning. Until the clock ticks 5AM and I realizedall those were part of my dream and excitement to attend my first day in online class.​</a>

Then, familiarize the rubrics and WRITE YOUR SHORT ANALYSIS My Dream in DreamIn this dream I was the girl with tattered short pants and shirt. I enjoyed each beautiful day and it's a blessing. My eyes were open before the rays of the sun shone. I folded my favorite blanket made of flour sack and took a long deep breath to begin the day. As I slowly tiptoed down the bamboo ladder, I saw my nanay staring in the air. Slowly moving towards her and gently tapped her shoulder; she turned to me with tears dwelling in her eyes and said, "I can't afford to send you to school. Those words struck and stunned me. Looking at my nanay's worried face, I hugged her tightly and closed my eyes as tears started to drop. I felt relieved and motivated feeling my nanay's warm hug of comfort. Then, I told her, "Don't worry nay. I will help you in any way I can. I won't stop studying." Saying that promise, I went out of our dilapidated house with determination to surpass this financially drain situation. As I walked along the street, I could smell the fresh, buttery bread which makes my empty stomach grumble in hunger. I respectfully approached the bakery owner standing just outside the bakeshop as she managed the workers. "Ma'am, may I sell your pandesal in our barangay? You may give me commission based on the sold bread. I need to help my nanay since she doesn't have work." The owner stared at me with a stern look from head to toe. Then she said in a bossy tone, "All right. Be honest!" I happily carried the heavy blue ice bucket with 50 pieces of pan desal in it. The heaviness did not bother me for I counted the commission to receive once sold. I shouted loudly, "PANDESAL! PANDESAL! PANDESAL!" It was eight o'clock in the morning when my pan desal was sold. I decided to sit under the shade of the big mango tree. I carefully counted the money if it was in right amount to remit to the owner. While I was counting, I heard group of boys talking, and I did not mind them. When suddenly SNAP! They snatched the money out of my hand and ran away. I was shocked and was not able to move. I felt my nerves were shaking and my blood was boiling. I only cried as my body was tired and my heart bleeds in anger. I felt the heavy tears in my eyes and realized it was all a dream.charactersplot - foreshadowing and flashbackPOVmoodsymboltonethemefig. lang​​</a>

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</a>

Read the following paragraph and identify the tense of the underlined verbs.
Last night, I dreamed that I was a ghost. In the dream, I was planning on pranking my
family and friends because they could not see me. I went around our house, trying to find a
pen and a piece of paper so that I could write down my plans. I had just found an old
notebook of mine when I realized that I couldn’t hold it even if I tried. My hands were just
sliding through it. I eventually gave up and decided that it wasn’t worth it to disturb
everyone. I will have been disappointed anyway if they didn’t realize it was me. Then, I woke
up and realized that it all happened in my sleep.

He thanked God for keeping him and his family safe during this pandemic.

To right the unrightable wrong, To love pure and chaste from afar. To try when your arms are too weary, To reach the unreachable star. This is my quest to, to follow the star, No matter how hopeless, no matter how far; To fight for the right without question or pause, To be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause. And I know if I'll only be true To this glorious quest That my heart will lie peaceful and calm, When I'm laid to my rest.

                                            I have been anticipating my senior year since the day I walked into my Kindergarten classroom. I always adored the older kids that only had one year of torture left. However; now that I am a senior, I absolutely cannot wait for the amazing opportunities that will come with this year. As my highschool career comes to an end, I have set some goals to ensure that I will have the best year possible. Although I have moved to a new place, and have been forced to start everything completely over again, I plan to make the most of this year. I want this year to be the best that I have ever had. One of the biggest goals that I have set for my senior year, is to pursue my dream to success. Graduating is a huge part of senior year, and I have been ready to graduate since birth, discover my passions and choose a path to college that will lead me to a successful career that I enjoy.I grew up a lot and matured to a level that allowed me to see my real potentialchanging my past for it is has led me to who I am now. However as I grow and reflect on circumstances that have occurred, I realize that there are instances in which I yearn that I would have done things differently.​</a>

Then, familiarize the rubrics and WRITE YOUR SHORT ANALYSIS My Dream in DreamIn this dream I was the girl with tattered short pants and shirt. I enjoyed each beautiful day and it's a blessing. My eyes were open before the rays of the sun shone. I folded my favorite blanket made of flour sack and took a long deep breath to begin the day. As I slowly tiptoed down the bamboo ladder, I saw my nanay staring in the air. Slowly moving towards her and gently tapped her shoulder; she turned to me with tears dwelling in her eyes and said, "I can't afford to send you to school. Those words struck and stunned me. Looking at my nanay's worried face, I hugged her tightly and closed my eyes as tears started to drop. I felt relieved and motivated feeling my nanay's warm hug of comfort. Then, I told her, "Don't worry nay. I will help you in any way I can. I won't stop studying." Saying that promise, I went out of our dilapidated house with determination to surpass this financially drain situation. As I walked along the street, I could smell the fresh, buttery bread which makes my empty stomach grumble in hunger. I respectfully approached the bakery owner standing just outside the bakeshop as she managed the workers. "Ma'am, may I sell your pandesal in our barangay? You may give me commission based on the sold bread. I need to help my nanay since she doesn't have work." The owner stared at me with a stern look from head to toe. Then she said in a bossy tone, "All right. Be honest!" I happily carried the heavy blue ice bucket with 50 pieces of pan desal in it. The heaviness did not bother me for I counted the commission to receive once sold. I shouted loudly, "PANDESAL! PANDESAL! PANDESAL!" It was eight o'clock in the morning when my pan desal was sold. I decided to sit under the shade of the big mango tree. I carefully counted the money if it was in right amount to remit to the owner. While I was counting, I heard group of boys talking, and I did not mind them. When suddenly SNAP! They snatched the money out of my hand and ran away. I was shocked and was not able to move. I felt my nerves were shaking and my blood was boiling. I only cried as my body was tired and my heart bleeds in anger. I felt the heavy tears in my eyes and realized it was all a dream.charactersplot - foreshadowing and flashbackPOVmoodsymboltonethemefig. lang​​</h2><br />

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</h2><br />

Last night, I dreamed that I was a ghost. In the dream, I was planning on pranking my
family and friends because they could not see me. I went around our house, trying to find a
pen and a piece of paper so that I could write down my plans. I had just found an old
notebook of mine when I realized that I couldn’t hold it even if I tried. My hands were just
sliding through it. I eventually gave up and decided that it wasn’t worth it to disturb
everyone. I will have been disappointed anyway if they didn’t realize it was me. Then, I woke
up and realized that it all happened in my sleep.

                            29. Impossible Dream To dream the impossible dream, To fight the unbeatable foe; To bear with unbearable sorrow, To run where the brave dare not go. To right the unrightable wrong, To love pure and chaste from afar. To try when your arms are too weary, To reach the unreachable star. This is my quest to, to follow the star, No matter how hopeless, no matter how far; To fight for the right without question or pause, To be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause. And I know if I'll only be true To this glorious quest That my heart will lie peaceful and calm, When I'm laid to my rest. Fo nly And the world will be better for this, That one man, scorned and covered with scars; Still strove, with his last ounce of courage, To reach the unreachable star.Questions1. what is the song about?2.Do you think they are impossible to achieve?why?3.what message doesthe song express?4. do you think it would be possible to realize your ambitions in life?if yes.why?or why not?explain your answer.5.what words with prefixes are found in the song?name them ​</h2><br />

                            30. I have been anticipating my senior year since the day I walked into my Kindergarten classroom. I always adored the older kids that only had one year of torture left. However; now that I am a senior, I absolutely cannot wait for the amazing opportunities that will come with this year. As my highschool career comes to an end, I have set some goals to ensure that I will have the best year possible. Although I have moved to a new place, and have been forced to start everything completely over again, I plan to make the most of this year. I want this year to be the best that I have ever had. One of the biggest goals that I have set for my senior year, is to pursue my dream to success. Graduating is a huge part of senior year, and I have been ready to graduate since birth, discover my passions and choose a path to college that will lead me to a successful career that I enjoy.I grew up a lot and matured to a level that allowed me to see my real potentialchanging my past for it is has led me to who I am now. However as I grow and reflect on circumstances that have occurred, I realize that there are instances in which I yearn that I would have done things differently.​</h2><br />
