For the Angeles Family, Mr. Angeles’s homecoming from his periodic inspection trips was an occasion for celebration.
But his homecoming-from a trip to the South-was fated to be more memorable than, say, of the others.
He had written from Mariveles; “I have just met a marvelous mat weaver a real artist-and I shall have a surprise for
you. I asked him to weave a sleeping mat for everyone in the family. He is using many different colors and for each the
dominant color is that of our respective birthstones. I am sure that the children will be very pleased. I know you will be. I can
hardly wait to show them to you.”
Nana Emilia read that letter that morning again and again every time she had a chance to leave the kitchen. In the
evening when all the children were home from school, she asked her oldest son, Jose, to read the letter at dinner table. The
children became very much excited about the mats and talked about them until late into the night. These thoughts made her
wrote her husband. For days after that, mats continued to be the chief topic of conversation among the children.
Mr. Angeles travelled to southern Philippines and brought mats for his wife and children. Each mat has the
corresponding name of all his living offspring, even those who already died. When he arrived home from his trip, he presented
the mats to his family. The sorrow heightened when the last three mats he opened are for his dead children who made his
wife reacted with grief.
At that point, Mr. Angeles cried with pain while telling his wife that the three dull colored mats were for Josefina,
Victoria and Concepcion. He added that his three dead children must always be in their memory no matter where they are
now.

Tomas Leonor, a graduate of Fine Arts from the University of the Philippines, 
founded and organized Step Juan, an expedition that aims to raise funds for the 
children with cancer. He is a freelance artist and a mountaineer. He volunteers for 
some environment organizations.
When he was a small boy, he suffered a few health problems. His dream was 
to travel around the Philippines. In 2009, he started to travel but by foot to help 
support children with cancer. He started from the northern part of the Philippines. He
earned 1.5 million pesos from walking around Luzon. By 2012, he earned 500,000 
pesos more. The amount was earmarked for his project of helping children with 
cancer. He gives medical aid and promotes public awareness about the plight of 
these children.
Tomas is a true modern Filipino hero. He is hardworking, persevering, and 
helpful. He gave up convenience for the sake of others. He never gave up hope on 
the children of our country. He does what is best for others and cares for them more 
than he cares for himself.
According to Tomas: “Real success is when you know in your heart that you 
have given it all your best and you have not used or stepped on anyone in order to 
reach that goal.”

dominant color is that of our respective birthstones. I am sure that the children will be very pleased. I know you will be. I can
hardly wait to show them to you.”
Nana Emilia read that letter that morning again and again every time she had a chance to leave the kitchen. In the
evening when all the children were home from school, she asked her oldest son, Jose, to read the letter at dinner table. The

Mr. Angeles travelled to southern Philippines and brought mats for his wife and children. Each mat has the
corresponding name of all his living offspring, even those who already died. When he arrived home from his trip, he presented
the mats to his family. The sorrow heightened when the last three mats he opened are for his dead children who made his
wife reacted with grief.
At that point, Mr. Angeles cried with pain while telling his wife that the three dull colored mats were for Josefina,
Victoria and Concepcion. He added that his three dead children must always be in their memory no matter where they are
now.

Tomas Leonor, a graduate of Fine Arts from the University of the Philippines, 
founded and organized Step Juan, an expedition that aims to raise funds for the 
children with cancer. He is a freelance artist and a mountaineer. He volunteers for 
some environment organizations.
When he was a small boy, he suffered a few health problems. His dream was 
to travel around the Philippines. In 2009, he started to travel but by foot to help 
support children with cancer. He started from the northern part of the Philippines. He
earned 1.5 million pesos from walking around Luzon. By 2012, he earned 500,000 
pesos more. The amount was earmarked for his project of helping children with 
cancer. He gives medical aid and promotes public awareness about the plight of 
these children.
Tomas is a true modern Filipino hero. He is hardworking, persevering, and 
helpful. He gave up convenience for the sake of others. He never gave up hope on 
the children of our country. He does what is best for others and cares for them more 
than he cares for himself.
According to Tomas: “Real success is when you know in your heart that you 
have given it all your best and you have not used or stepped on anyone in order to 
reach that goal.”

                            21. Exercise C Instructions: Analyze the given dialogue. Identify the kind of relationship that the speakers and listeners have and explain the effect on language form, duration of interaction, the relationship of speaker-audience, role and responsibilities of the speaker, message, and delivery when the speakers shifted in speech context, speech style, speech act, and communicative strategy. You do not have to discuss all the effects. You may opt to discuss the effects on language form, message, and delivery for example. Use another sheet of paper for your answer and attach it to this activity sheet. A rubric is given to serve as your guide to achieving a very good score. You: Ma, I would like to pursue business management at my college. Papa: (enters the dining area and interrupts) Business management??? You: Of course! To earn a lot of money. For your new shoes (laughing)! Mama: (disagreeing) Get another course, NOT THAT. The tuition fee is TOO EXPENSIVE. You: No! That's what I want. Papa: Ok, but we do not enough have money for that course. You: (disrespectful tone) It's your responsibility, not mine. Mama: (raising voice) YOU SHOULD NOT TALK THAT WAY, WE ARE YOUR PARENTS! Have some respect, anak. You: Sorry po! I said that because I want to study. But, I can go to work so I can study. I will multiply myself to my work and school at that time. Mama and Papa: (laughing voice) What do you mean "multiply?" You made us laugh. You: Nothing. I said "Mahal ko po kayo."​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>From the given dialogue, it can be inferred that the speakers have a familial relationship. The effect of the familial relationship on language form is manifested in the use of informal language, such as the use of terms like “Ma” and “Papa”, as well as the use of the Tagalog term “anak”. The duration of interaction is lengthy, as the dialogue is composed of multiple exchanges between the speakers. The relationship of speaker-audience is interactive in nature, as both parties actively exchange ideas. The role and responsibilities of the speaker is to express their opinion and ideas, as well as to provide feedback to the other speakers. The message communicated is that the speaker is interested in pursuing business management at college, and the delivery is done in a respectful and humorous manner. When the speakers shifted in speech context, the tone shifted from a serious one to a more lighthearted one. The shift in speech style was from a formal one to an informal one. The shift in speech act was from a directive one to a humorous one. The shift in communicative strategy was from a confrontational one to a collaborative one.</p><br />

                            26. Exercise C Instructions: Analyze the given dialogue. Identify the kind of relationship that the speakers and listeners have and explain the effect on language form, duration of interaction, the relationship of speaker-audience, role and responsibilities of the speaker, message, and delivery when the speakers shifted in speech context, speech style, speech act, and communicative strategy. You do not have to discuss all the effects. You may opt to discuss the effects on language form, message, and delivery for example. Use another sheet of paper for your answer and attach it to this activity sheet. A rubric is given to serve as your guide to achieving a very good score.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>In this dialogue, the speakers have a familial relationship. The effect of this relationship on language form can be seen in the use of familiar terms and pronouns, such as "Ma," "Papa," and "anak," which are used to address family members in Filipino. This also affects the duration of interaction, as familial relationships tend to involve longer and more frequent interactions compared to other types of relationships.</p><p></p><p>The relationship between the speaker and audience in this dialogue is that of parent and child, with the parents serving as the audience and the child speaking to them. This affects the role and responsibilities of the speaker, as the child is expected to show respect and obedience to their parents.</p><p></p><p>The message in this dialogue revolves around the child's desire to pursue a college degree in business management, and the parents' disagreement with this decision due to financial concerns. The delivery of this message is affected by the shift in speech context, as the conversation moves from a casual conversation to a more serious discussion about the child's education and future. This can also be seen in the shift in speech style, from a casual and joking tone to a more respectful and serious tone.</p><p></p><p>The shift in communicative strategy can also be seen in the child's use of the term "multiply" in response to their parents' questioning of their statement. This is likely an attempt by the child to defuse the tension and lighten the mood by making a joke.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the effects of the familial relationship on language form, duration of interaction, speaker-audience relationship, and delivery can be seen throughout the dialogue.</p><p></p><p>Pabrainliest :)</p><p></p><br />
