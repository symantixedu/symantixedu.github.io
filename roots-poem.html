Thine individual being, shalt thou go
To mix forever with the elements,
To be a brother to the insensible rock
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain
Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mold.

STORM Jaime Jesus Borlagdan This is the weight stripped off by the sky mixed are the earth and water.If the disorder will be put back in place or traced, It would be like peeling away from a sticky embrace.Twisted are the limbs of electricity and branches, broken by strain slumped at each other.The leaves, the pebbles which tore the windows.Scratches, sap were the solidified tracks.Marks of the gushing path Of the ocean which walked the earth,Last night under the twister moon Whose beam was inward to its own gloom. The embrace of the Habagat, south wind, was a whipping tight Brutal pressure whose desire is to devour The world in one clenched hand. Almost without fear, almost close to be like love Which enveloped all. On the roads, in the veins The waited which was met By anxiety Wafted like untamed horses, At the clearing of dust The morning was a crumpled sheet. Remained was the soil naked. There in the falling of the flower To the dirt which nursed the root, Bloomed the scent Of the trampled upon grass. In the surfacing of light Clarity again is formed.

Deep inside the soil my roots are found, Drinking the water underground. Water from the roots my trunk receives, Then my trunk starts making leaves. 2. As I start to climb in altitude, Leaves on my branches will make food. Soon my trunk and branches will grow wide, And I'll grow more bark outside! 3. I will be a maple very tall, Losing my leaves when it is fall. But when it is spring, new leaves will show.​</a>

Go to the root of things.
Stalk them as they surface
and tip
wordless like shoots
in your mother’s gabi patch
unguents for stomachs
afternoons in long March.
Watch them.
Watch as beginnings
close upon ends
and October noon
when storms find shelter
under shaking gabi leaves
with a brazen snake entangled
among a mother hen and her motley brood
you’ll have joys
stinging in your guts.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Persona refers to the voice a writer creates to tell a story or to define the speaker in a poem. Sometimes the writer may share real-life experience or feelings in autobiographical writing. Or he may write as a detached observer, keeping a distance from events in the poem, or an imaginary character.<p></p>Dont give up! &lt;3<p></p><br />

Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mold.

                        Answer:<br /><br />1)Do plants and animals reproduce? <br />        -All organisms reproduce, which is the biological process where an organism produces and/or gives birth to another organism. Both plants and animals reproduce, though they have evolved the processes so that they overlap and diverge from each other in several ways.<br /><br /><br />2)What is the reproductive organs of plant? <br />        -As a plant's reproductive part, a flower contains a stamen (male flower part) or pistil (female flower part), or both, plus accessory parts such as sepals, petals, and nectar glands. The stamen is the male reproductive organ. It consists of a pollen sac (anther) and a long supporting filament.<br /><br /><br />3)What are the functions of flowers, leaves and stems? <br />       -Function of leaves is to cook food for the plant by photosynthesis and exchange of gases. Flowers are used for reproduction. Function of stem is to provide support to the plant and transport material throughout the plant. Function of root is to absorb water and dissolve nutrients and anchor plant in the ground.<br /><br /><br />4)What will happen if some organs of plants are destroyed?<br />       -Maybe there is a higher chance that all plants can't product more air or food. Then at that case maybe the Nature will fall over.<br /><br /><br />5)What will happen if root are damage?<br />       -Damaged roots can cause buds and twigs to immediately die, weakening the plant. The weakened plant may then begin to show decline symptoms such as lack of vigor and reduced growth. Plants with damaged roots show symptoms on the side of the plant where roots have been severed.<br /><br /><br />6)What makes the organs of a plant?<br />        -Plant organs are made up of cells. The most basic cell type, which makes up the ground tissue in plants, is the parenchyma cell. Although all tissue types contain parenchyma, certain tissues are predominantly parenchyma, including the cortex and pith in stems and roots, and the mesophyll in leaves.<br /><br /><br />7)Do plants and animals have same organs system?<br />         -Plants and animals are very different from one another, but they also have important similarities. Both are living things, and both have organ systems that are necessary for survival.<br /><br />Hope it helps! ;)<br />

These emotions and feelings help establish a certain atmosphere or mood. The writer of the poem creates the mood using a number of elements such as setting, tone and theme. To define the mood of a poem, the reader should analyze how these different elements interact and what feeling or atmosphere they evoke.</p><br />

afternoons in long March.
Watch them.
Watch as beginnings
close upon ends
and October noon
when storms find shelter
under shaking gabi leaves
with a brazen snake entangled
among a mother hen and her motley brood
you’ll have joys
stinging in your guts.</h2><br />
