Expository text #1
Suggested illustration: Map or Flow chart 
In times of disaster, you may need to evacuate from your house and go to a safe 
place. At other times, you may need to stay indoors. 
 If you are asked to evacuate, it is best to have an evacuation map to get to a safe 
place. The map should be known to all members of the family. It should contain 
landmarks in the community (e.g. churches, schools, health centers, fire stations, police 
stations, barangay halls) and if possible, evacuation centers with routes that show how to 
get there. 
 Draw your house and the route to get to the evacuation center in your area. Mark all 
the roads as well as the buildings mentioned above. 
In your community, where do you go in times of disaster?

                                            B. Use Law of Detachment to draw conclusion 1. If two lines are parallel, then they do not intersect.  Lines j and k are parallel. 2. If there is lightning, then it is not safe to play outside. Peter saw lightning. 3. If you get an average grade of 95– 100, then you will be in the honor roll Your average grade is 95.25. 4. If a figure is a triangle, then the sum of the angles is 1800. PQR is is a triangle. 5. If the sum of two angles is equal to 90 degrees, then the angles are com plementary. Angle x is equal to 30 degrees and angle y is equal to 60 degrees.  6. If two circles have the same center, then they are concentric. The center of two circles is point A. 7. If a figure has 4 sides, then it is a quadrilateral Square has 4 sides. 8. If the 2 integers are odd, then the sum is even number The numbers x and y are odd integers. 9. If the score in math exam is 50 and above, then you passed the exam. Rick scored 68 in the exam. 10. If points lie on a line, then they are collinear. Points X, Y, and Z are in line m.  C. Use Law of Syllogism to draw conclusion. Determine if your conclusion is  valid or not. Justify your answer 1. If it continue to rain then, then the track and field oval will become wet and  slippery. If the track and field oval will become wet and slippery, then the track and  field game will be cancelled. 2. If you are resting, then you will be relaxed. If you are relaxed, then your heart beat is normal. 3. If you study your lesson, then you will pass the exam. If you pass the exam, you will get a good grade. 4. If it creature is a fly , then it has and antennae.  If the creature has antennae, then it is an insect. 5. If you are studying science, then you are studying biology. If you are studying biology, then you are studying botany. 6. If two lines are parallel, then they belong to one plane. If lines belong to one plane, then they are coplanar. 7. If angles are linear pair, then they are supplementary angles. If the angles are supplementary, the sum of the angles is 1800. 8. If a man is good in Math, then he is an engineer. If he is an engineer, then he can build a house.  9. If a creature is a mammal, then it has 2 legs. If a creature has 2 legs, then it can swim 10.

Expository text #1
Suggested illustration: Map or Flow chart 
In times of disaster, you may need to evacuate from your house and go to a safe 
place. At other times, you may need to stay indoors. 
 If you are asked to evacuate, it is best to have an evacuation map to get to a safe 
place. The map should be known to all members of the family. It should contain 
landmarks in the community (e.g. churches, schools, health centers, fire stations, police 
stations, barangay halls) and if possible, evacuation centers with routes that show how to 
get there. 
 Draw your house and the route to get to the evacuation center in your area. Mark all 
the roads as well as the buildings mentioned above. 
In your community, where do you go in times of disaster?

If a figure is a triangle, then the sum of the angles is 1800. PQR is is a triangle. 5. If the sum of two angles is equal to 90 degrees, then the angles are com plementary. Angle x is equal to 30 degrees and angle y is equal to 60 degrees.  6. If two circles have the same center, then they are concentric. The center of two circles is point A. 7. If a figure has 4 sides, then it is a quadrilateral Square has 4 sides. 8. If the 2 integers are odd, then the sum is even number The numbers x and y are odd integers. 9. If the score in math exam is 50 and above, then you passed the exam. Rick scored 68 in the exam. 10. If points lie on a line, then they are collinear. Points X, Y, and Z are in line m.  C. Use Law of Syllogism to draw conclusion. Determine if your conclusion is  valid or not. Justify your answer 1. If it continue to rain then, then the track and field oval will become wet and  slippery. If the track and field oval will become wet and slippery, then the track and  field game will be cancelled. 2. If you are resting, then you will be relaxed.

                            16. TASKS: 1. On a separate sheet of paper, answer the problem below and write a reflection journal entitled "Solving Problems involving Permutations and Combinations". 2. Use the following format.I. Things Learned and Insights What are the things that you have learned in this problem? II. Which Part of the problem Shows a permutation? a combination? III. Concept Map: (Draw a diagram showing the connections of the lesson.) IV. Difficulties: What part of the problem do you find it hard to understand? V. Unforgettable Experiences/Activities What part of the problem you enjoyed the most? Problem: In a place where Nena and her family lives, they pay a large sum of money for house rental. It has a safe, comfortable, clean and quiet environment but due to the pandemic, her mother lost her job, and they have enough income to pay for their house rental, so her parents decided to look for another house with affordable rental. Fortunately, they were able to find a house as safe and comfortable as what they had but with an affordable rental. As they move to their new home, Nena encounters a problem. She has a collection of dolls, but she cannot take them all with her. In how many ways can Nena select 3 dolls out of 10 dolls and the remaining 7 dolls be given to her friends? In how many ways can she arrange the 3 selected dolls in a row?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> I. Things Learned and Insights:</p><p>In solving the given problem, I have learned that permutations and combinations are important concepts in mathematics that deal with the arrangement and selection of objects, respectively. The order of objects is important in permutations, while it is not in combinations. I have also learned the formula for computing permutations and combinations and how to apply them to solve real-life problems.</p><p></p><p>II. Which Part of the problem Shows a permutation? a combination?</p><p>The problem involves two parts that show permutation and combination, respectively. The first part of the problem deals with the selection of 3 dolls out of 10 dolls, which is a combination since the order of selection does not matter. The second part of the problem deals with the arrangement of the 3 selected dolls in a row, which is a permutation since the order of arrangement matters.</p><p></p><p>III. Concept Map:</p><p>Permutations and Combinations</p><p></p><p>Permutations: arrangement of objects where the order matters</p><p>Formula: P(n,r) = n!/(n-r)!</p><p>Combinations: selection of objects where the order does not matter</p><p>Formula: C(n,r) = n!/(r!(n-r)!)</p><p>Real-life applications:</p><p>Selecting a committee</p><p>Arranging books on a shelf</p><p>Choosing lottery numbers</p><p>IV. Difficulties:</p><p>I did not encounter any major difficulties in solving the problem. However, it is important to take note of the difference between permutation and combination to avoid confusion and errors in computation.</p><p></p><p>V. Unforgettable Experiences/Activities:</p><p>The part of the problem that I enjoyed the most is computing the permutations and combinations using the formulas. It is satisfying to see how simple formulas can help solve complex problems, and how these concepts can be applied in real-life situations.</p><p></p><br />
