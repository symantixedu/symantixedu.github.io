The rich man also died and was buried; </p><p>23 and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes, and saw Abraham far off and Laz′arus in his bosom. </p><p>24 And he called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and send Laz′arus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.’ </p><p>25 But Abraham said, ‘Son, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Laz′arus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. </p><p>26 And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.’ </p><p>27 And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father’s house, </p><p>28 for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.’ </p><p>29 But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.’ </p><p>30 And he said, ‘No, father Abraham; but if some one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’ </p><p>31 He said to him, ‘If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if some one should rise from the dead.’”</p><p></p>Reflection<p>We must share our possessions/belongings because when we serve other people, we serve God. Everything we own is God's, and we need to help someone in need.</p><br />

                            2. September 11,2022 sunday gospel with reflection​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Sunday Gospel, September 11, 2022</strong><p></p><p><strong>Luke 15:1-32</strong></p><p>"he said, 'Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet. Then go and get the prize calf and kill it, and let us celebrate with a feast! For this son of mine was dead, but now he is alive; he was lost but now he has been found."</p><p></p>Reflection<p>According to the gospel of today, life would be considered to be dead without the Father. Once we turn away from Our Father, it is without love, humility, and mercy. Nevertheless, despite all of our faults and rejection by Him, His love and mercy continue. He will always love and accept us, no matter what we did or how many times we sinned. He will always find us and see us. Return Home to Our Father's arms. There are souls that resemble a lost flock of sheep. They are at least conscious of their current predicament despite being spiritually damaged and essentially unable to help themselves. They are similar to those who begin the AA process by acknowledging that they have reached their breaking point and are out of control. They whine and beg for assistance. Because they are unable to move on their own, when God discovers them, he carries them back.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Read more about gospels and word of God:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/25908248?referrer=searchResults</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/6740320?referrer=searchResults</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                            5. gospel reflection October 2 2022​</h2><br />
                        Reflection for the 27th Sunday in Ordinary Time- October 2, 2022<p></p><p>In today's Gospel Jesus teaches us about faith and discipleship. We are reminded that with faith, irrespective of how small, we must be ready to do wonderful things in the service of God.</p><p></p><p>This Sunday’s gospel begins with Jesus’ disciples saying, “Lord, increase our faith.” Many times, we begin to question our faith when it seems that God isn’t answering our prayers. We cannot compare our faith with that of others. Patience together with our faith is important. My grandmother would often use the maxim that goes, “God may not come when you want him but he is always on time.”</p><p></p><p>Faith is a necessary aspect of discipleship. God wants to do wonderful things in our lives. God’s plan is always directed towards what is good for us. We must seek patience as we wait for the completion of God’s work in our lives. Only a little amount of faith is required to strengthen us on our journey with Jesus.</p><p></p><p>We must continue to discern our role in God’s plan. As God’s hands and feet in this world, we offer our lives in service to building God’s kingdom. Having greater faith is not for bragging but as a servant of God’s plan for us all. Even with faith, there’ll be difficulties and frustrations, in being Jesus’ disciples. Rooted in faith, we gain strength that comes from the God of all Grace, we know and believe that we are a part of God’s plan.</p><p><strong></strong></p><strong>Hope it helps you mate</strong><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>No other religious leader in history has stated more emphatically than Jesus Christ that what we do in this life has eternal ramifications. Believing in Jesus is a wonderful gift from God. Anyone who conducts a nice deed in His name will undoubtedly be blessed. The positive things we do, even if they appear tiny, such as giving food to beggars, will not go unnoticed. Remember people in your own life to whom you owe a great obligation for the positive guidance and example they provided. The Holy Spirit is like the wind, blowing wherever it pleases and working secretly in every heart. God has a big imagination and works hard to put together everything for the good of the world. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa barinliest naman po.. Thank you in advance. </p><br />

</strong></p><p><strong>In the synagogue there was a man possessed by an evil spirit who shouted in a loud voice, "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us?

The evil spirit then threw the man down in front of them and came out of him without doing him harm.  </strong></p><p><strong>

                        <p><strong>Answer: Gospel Reflection: Matthew 20:1-16</strong></p><p><strong>In our modern times, we have heard some common terms, issues and complaints in the labor market such as unemployment, inequality, unfair labor practices, security of tenure, and other workers’ rights. Some people are quick to use the gospel passage above to defend their positions or point of views. And why not? The gospel in particular and the bible in general should be used to guide us in our modern daily life. The problem though arises when we use the scripture to defend what is patently evil or illegal. The parable of the laborers illustrates that our concept of justice is different from God. As we all know that in all things God is good and it is His goodness that makes all the difference. We can never fathom the compassion of God towards us. Yet, when He shows His compassion towards our neighbor, we feel jealous and try to compare them to our situation. Then we start to complain.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Jesus once said that God provides rain for the just and unjust alike (Matthew 5:45). Therefore, we His children has no right to feel jealous when our seemingly “bad” neighbor receives more blessings than us just like the laborers who worked for only a few hours but received the full day’s pay. This only means that we are all equal in the eyes of God and each one of us has a good chance of having eternal life, not because we are good, but because God is good; Not because we have been serving in the church for a long time but because God has redeemed us through the blood of Jesus.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The first will be the last and the last will be the first. Jesus Iscariot have come to know and follow Jesus for a long time but he went on his way, not the way of Jesus. The thief who was crucified together with Jesus was, in a moment, the recipient of the promise of eternal life. This should be a warning to all of us. There is absolutely nothing that we can boast of except the cross of Jesus which allowed us to gain eternal life.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The first will be the last and the last will be the first. This does not mean we can wait for our last breath before we accept the call of Jesus for repentance and renewal. It only means there is still hope for anyone to be a saint even at the last minute.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>GOSPEL REFLECTION LAST DECEMBER 24, 2022 </strong>LUKE 1:67-79<p><strong>Merry Christmas,</strong> dear ones! I hope your Advent was peaceful and concentrating on Jesus rather than worrying about presents. Our vacations are quieter because our youngest is 18 years old. I value it since I'm more concentrated.</p><p><strong>Priest Zechariah</strong> questioned what the angel <strong>Gabriel </strong>told him. The message from God sounded too fantastic to be true for him to believe it. Have you been there before? Me, <strong>countless</strong> times.</p><p>Earlier, the angel Gabriel states in Luke 1:20,“But now you will be speechless and unable to talk until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at their proper time.”</p><p>Up to the birth of John, Zechariah is unable to speak once more. Zechariah's skepticism helps us relate to this amazing man so much. How many times have w<strong>e pleaded</strong> with God for <strong>mercy</strong> and <strong>expressed gratitude</strong> as we marvel at the <strong>promises </strong>He has fulfilled despite our skepticism of His Truth? It is very demeaning.</p><p>We recall the Canticle of Zechariah, where he declares the accomplishment of God's final promise to everyone, as we watch for the choir of angels and the Christmas star to illuminate the night.</p><p>Zechariah proclaimed about John: "You, my child, will be called prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way, to give his people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins." Luke 1:76-77"</p>REFLECTION:<p>We may start to<strong> comprehend</strong> Jesus' words and deeds more clearly if we realize that he was not just another teacher and healer, but rather Yahweh working among his people. If we<strong> examine</strong> the texts of the Old Testament—and the first Christians relentlessly read Jesus in the context of these writings—we see that Yahweh was <strong>anticipated</strong> to <strong>accomplish</strong> <strong>four</strong> significant tasks: he would gather the <strong>dispersed</strong> tribes of Israel; he would<strong> purify</strong> the holy temple in Jerusalem; he would <strong>definitively </strong>deal with the nation's enemies; and finally, he would<strong> reign</strong> as <strong>Lord</strong> of the <strong>world.</strong></p><p>To understand more on how Gospel is formed and shared, kindly click this link below:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/17686847</p><p></p><p></p><p>#SPJ9</p><br />

Whoever is not against us is for us. For truly I tell you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ will by no means lose the reward.</p><p></p><p>‘If any of you put a stumbling-block before one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for you if a great millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea. If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire. And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and to be thrown into hell.

                        <p>Gospel: Mk 9:30-37
</p><p>After leaving that place, they made their way through Galilee; but Jesus did not want people to know where he was because he was teaching his disciples. And he told them, “The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, but three days after he has been killed, he will rise.” The disciples, however, did not understand these words and they were afraid to ask him what he meant. Who is the greatest? They came to Capernaum and, once inside the house, Jesus asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?”But they did not answer, because they had been arguing about who was the greatest. Then he sat down, called the Twelve and said to them, “If someone wants to be first, let him be last of all and servant of all.” Then he took a little child, placed him in their midst, and putting his arms  </p><br /><p>around him he said to them, “Whoever welcomes a child such as this in my name, welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me, but the One who sent me.”</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Gospel Reflection September 1, 2019 | 22nd Sunday in ordinary time </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>In <strong>Luke 14:1, 7-14, </strong>Jesus was telling a parable about a person who was invited to a party and sat at the high table. But he told by the host to sat at the low table and he was embarrassed. The other person, sat at the low table and he was noticed by the host and told him "My friend, move to a higher position". </p><p>In the parable, Jesus teaches us to humbles ourselves because <strong>those who are full of pride will be humbled and those who are humble will be promoted</strong> and <strong>those who have a proud heart can't worship the Lord</strong> because his heart is full of pride. <strong>If a person has a humble heart, he knows how to prostrate and worship the Lord. </strong></p><p></p><p>Pray this ejaculatory prayer: </p><p>"<strong>Jesus, meek and humble of heart, teach my heart how to be like yours."</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
