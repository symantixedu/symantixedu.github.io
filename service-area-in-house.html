                                            In the Philippines, more than one third of the urban population lives in informal settlements. More than half of these urban poor families (1.4 million) live in Metro Manila. In theory, theGovernment has addressed the concerns of the urban poor concern through its “Urban Development and Housing Act” (UDHA), which is intended to provide adequate housing at affordable cost, basic services, and employment opportunities for the slum residents in resettlement areas. However, owing to insufficient capacities at the local level and the lack of appropriate mechanisms to ensure cooperation and consultation in problem solving, the conditions of urban slum residents have only worsened, and they continue to face eviction and demolition from both the government and private landowners.ISSUE: _______________________(social issue, moral issue, economic issue)​</a>

More than half of these urban poor families (1.4 million) live in Metro Manila. In theory, theGovernment has addressed the concerns of the urban poor concern through its “Urban Development and Housing Act” (UDHA), which is intended to provide adequate housing at affordable cost, basic services, and employment opportunities for the slum residents in resettlement areas. However, owing to insufficient capacities at the local level and the lack of appropriate mechanisms to ensure cooperation and consultation in problem solving, the conditions of urban slum residents have only worsened, and they continue to face eviction and demolition from both the government and private landowners.ISSUE: _______________________(social issue, moral issue, economic issue)​</h2><br />
