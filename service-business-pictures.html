                                            The salon's interior is very neat and simple, with mirrors, swivel chairs screwed to the ground, and a wash area. It hasn't changed much since it last opened. Despite this, the salon still has a jolly vibe because of how long the staff and the community have been acquainted. Their prices are low to mid-range. The staff are undeniably skilled at their craft and provide excellent customer service. Recently, Goldie and Long Locks noticed a decline in the number of its younger customers. They started to have their hair done at salons that are farther and slightly more expensive. Upon asking around, she discovered that her former clients opted for salons whose services always keep up with the trends, such as the hair colors and styles offered because of the rise of social media. They also appreciate that these salons use the latest hair care products. Another reason why they decided to shift salons is that these aesthetically pleasing salons provide good material that they can post on their social media. Goldie is aware that this issue needs to be mitigated to ensure the continuity of their business. However, she needs your help to see the bigger picture and make the right plans.

                            12. The salon's interior is very neat and simple, with mirrors, swivel chairs screwed to the ground, and a wash area. It hasn't changed much since it last opened. Despite this, the salon still has a jolly vibe because of how long the staff and the community have been acquainted. Their prices are low to mid-range. The staff are undeniably skilled at their craft and provide excellent customer service. Recently, Goldie and Long Locks noticed a decline in the number of its younger customers. They started to have their hair done at salons that are farther and slightly more expensive. Upon asking around, she discovered that her former clients opted for salons whose services always keep up with the trends, such as the hair colors and styles offered because of the rise of social media. They also appreciate that these salons use the latest hair care products. Another reason why they decided to shift salons is that these aesthetically pleasing salons provide good material that they can post on their social media. Goldie is aware that this issue needs to be mitigated to ensure the continuity of their business. However, she needs your help to see the bigger picture and make the right plans.
