on the space provided.
General Statement: Owls and bats have similarities and differences.
Owls and Bats
There are many ways that owls and bats are similar. Owls and bats are both nocturnal. This
means that they sleep during the day and they are awake at night. At night, they hunt for their
food. Owls and bats eat some of the same types of food such as insects and small rodents.
While owls and bats can both fly, only one is considered to be a type of bird. Owls are birds
while bats are mammals. Unlike owls, bats have fur instead of feathers. Owls hatch from eggs
but bats are born alive.
Task 2. (Answers)
Task 3. BE AN ACE DETECTIVE! Read the following short stories below and look for an evidence
from the text to support the general statement.
A.
Every day after work Paul took his muddy boots off on the steps of the front porch. Alice would
have a fit if the boots made it so far as the welcome mat. He then took off his dusty overalls and
threw them into a plastic garbage bag; Alice left a new garbage bag tied to the porch railing for him
every morning. On his way in the house, he dropped the garbage bag off at the washing machine
and went straight up the stairs to the shower as he was instructed. He would eat dinner with her
after he was "presentable," as Alice had often said.
1. Cite evidence that Paul is a construction worker.
2. Cite evidence that the characters are husband and wife.
3. Cite phrases from the text that Alice is an organized person.</a>

                                            what is this poem all about? SHAMAN (for the Sukdan of Inabanga) By: Dr. Ulysses B. Aparece We both believe in this: place As either timed or timeless. A constant watchman though I am, I still dare cross the far boundaries In search of the other side of space. Gatherer of leaves, root, stones, you are The keeper of the ancient craft of touch Extending welcome to a new realm Where begins the travel of remembering. So I gain entrance to this great beyond, I must admit I carry a baggage for you To unburden, these fruits of my living. You thus begin your shaman’s journey On my body, a vast geography of frightened Muscles, bones, nerves, joints, veins. Your hands whisper the secrets of gabun, Kulavu, tanglad, kugang-kugan…. Green residences of gentle duwendes. Skill of hands untangles invisible knots In my stomach, quieting down murmurs Of the heart; yours is a sweet gurgle Of rivulets, breath of earth and forest: Mutya sa Kuampang, mutya sa Panghagban Mutya sa Matinlig, mutya sa Puwawan… Strange prayer that never really matters. The means is the message, a message, Until your crystals proclaim this portent: The world I left in one certain moment Has followed me with much vengeance, Now shakes your space from fossilized sleep. O great healer of fear—medicine man, Tambalan, oracionan, baylan, sukdan— What has happened to your knowing hands, Can’t they resist with open palms these Beastly creatures, maps of hardest structures? Where are your spirit familiars? Your canticles from the sanctuary called heart Cannot outlast the monster’s roars lording Over bleeding shrubberies, drowning Your place’s whispers, breezes sighs. How, in the end, you have become Your own province, of silence: red rivulets, Purple boundaries, capital wound. Mine, now, is the knowing touch of duty, Filling the void, wishing to connect, Sending you off, never letting go.​</a>

I got to school about 15 minutes after the fifth period bell. rest of the school day was normal. looking for people, doing my work, try not to be alone, you know... after school was me trying to get the boy I like to notice me since he kept ignoring me. it was really hard to manage it. in the end, we sat at a table and we were talking for about two and a half hours. since my dad can't use the tracker anymore he left the house to look for me. when I saw him I had just gotten off the bus, but I didn't want to be picked up so I kept walking... when I got home I started to clean my room and a half was cleaning my desk he came home. he yelled at me for about 30 min about everything. I am blaming my mom for my dad having to come to find me. reason? she is the one that disabled my number. when we originally discussed my number it was just going to be restricted. but no. after he finished, I went to my room and cried for about 30 min. after I was ready I went to eat. when I was almost done he came and yelled at me AGAIN for the same things. the only thing that kept me calm was the fact that I was eating. (and reading...) so as you can tell, my life is hell for me. and I'm not even going to get into my love life... so please tell me what you think.</a>

General Statement: Owls and bats have similarities and differences.
Owls and Bats
There are many ways that owls and bats are similar. Owls and bats are both nocturnal. This
means that they sleep during the day and they are awake at night. At night, they hunt for their
food. Owls and bats eat some of the same types of food such as insects and small rodents.
While owls and bats can both fly, only one is considered to be a type of bird. Owls are birds
while bats are mammals. Unlike owls, bats have fur instead of feathers. Owls hatch from eggs
but bats are born alive.

Every day after work Paul took his muddy boots off on the steps of the front porch. Alice would
have a fit if the boots made it so far as the welcome mat. He then took off his dusty overalls and
threw them into a plastic garbage bag; Alice left a new garbage bag tied to the porch railing for him
every morning. On his way in the house, he dropped the garbage bag off at the washing machine
and went straight up the stairs to the shower as he was instructed. He would eat dinner with her
after he was "presentable," as Alice had often said.
1. Cite evidence that Paul is a construction worker.
2. Cite evidence that the characters are husband and wife.
3. Cite phrases from the text that Alice is an organized person.</h2><br />

                            26. what is this poem all about? SHAMAN (for the Sukdan of Inabanga) By: Dr. Ulysses B. Aparece We both believe in this: place As either timed or timeless. A constant watchman though I am, I still dare cross the far boundaries In search of the other side of space. Gatherer of leaves, root, stones, you are The keeper of the ancient craft of touch Extending welcome to a new realm Where begins the travel of remembering. So I gain entrance to this great beyond, I must admit I carry a baggage for you To unburden, these fruits of my living. You thus begin your shaman’s journey On my body, a vast geography of frightened Muscles, bones, nerves, joints, veins. Your hands whisper the secrets of gabun, Kulavu, tanglad, kugang-kugan…. Green residences of gentle duwendes. Skill of hands untangles invisible knots In my stomach, quieting down murmurs Of the heart; yours is a sweet gurgle Of rivulets, breath of earth and forest: Mutya sa Kuampang, mutya sa Panghagban Mutya sa Matinlig, mutya sa Puwawan… Strange prayer that never really matters. The means is the message, a message, Until your crystals proclaim this portent: The world I left in one certain moment Has followed me with much vengeance, Now shakes your space from fossilized sleep. O great healer of fear—medicine man, Tambalan, oracionan, baylan, sukdan— What has happened to your knowing hands, Can’t they resist with open palms these Beastly creatures, maps of hardest structures? Where are your spirit familiars? Your canticles from the sanctuary called heart Cannot outlast the monster’s roars lording Over bleeding shrubberies, drowning Your place’s whispers, breezes sighs. How, in the end, you have become Your own province, of silence: red rivulets, Purple boundaries, capital wound. Mine, now, is the knowing touch of duty, Filling the void, wishing to connect, Sending you off, never letting go.​</h2><br />

                            29. how messed up is this?!
 my mom turned off my phone number for 6 months unless I can get my grades up. (i have mostly d's and a couple of f's and one c...) and now my dad can't call me or use the tracker. no number means no tracker. and I have a hard time sleeping as it is. I wake up late a lot of the time but before I would have people call me in the mornings to wake me up. I have 2 alarms that go off. and yesterday I decided to use my third one. I still was late for school. I got to school about 15 minutes after the fifth period bell. rest of the school day was normal. looking for people, doing my work, try not to be alone, you know... after school was me trying to get the boy I like to notice me since he kept ignoring me. it was really hard to manage it. in the end, we sat at a table and we were talking for about two and a half hours. since my dad can't use the tracker anymore he left the house to look for me. when I saw him I had just gotten off the bus, but I didn't want to be picked up so I kept walking... when I got home I started to clean my room and a half was cleaning my desk he came home. he yelled at me for about 30 min about everything. I am blaming my mom for my dad having to come to find me. reason? she is the one that disabled my number. when we originally discussed my number it was just going to be restricted. but no. after he finished, I went to my room and cried for about 30 min. after I was ready I went to eat. when I was almost done he came and yelled at me AGAIN for the same things. the only thing that kept me calm was the fact that I was eating. (and reading...) so as you can tell, my life is hell for me. and I'm not even going to get into my love life... so please tell me what you think.</h2><br />
