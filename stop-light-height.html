1. Place a book on top of a table. What keeps the book from falling?
How is this possible?
2. Roll a marble on top of a level surface. Make it stop. Slide a light book
on top of the same level surface by giving it an initial push. Did the
book continue to slide? What is responsible for making the sliding
book slow down and eventually stop?
3. Drop a small stone and a piece of paper from the same height at the
same time. Observe closely the motion of the stone and the paper
as they fall. Which of them reached the ground first? Why did not the
other one reach the ground at the same time as the first?
4. What is the importance of friction in our daily life?
5. Why do we need gravity?</a>

<p>
</p>2) The book did not continue to slide. Friction is responsible for making the sliding book slow down and eventually stop.
<p>
</p>3) The stone is much speeder because it's flat and the stone is small so it motion to our gravity is slow.

1. Place a book on top of a table. What keeps the book from falling?
How is this possible?
2. Roll a marble on top of a level surface. Make it stop. Slide a light book
on top of the same level surface by giving it an initial push. Did the
book continue to slide? What is responsible for making the sliding
book slow down and eventually stop?
3. Drop a small stone and a piece of paper from the same height at the
same time. Observe closely the motion of the stone and the paper
as they fall. Which of them reached the ground first? Why did not the
other one reach the ground at the same time as the first?
4. What is the importance of friction in our daily life?
5. Why do we need gravity?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The table stops the book from falling.</p><p>2. Because of the book and the force change, the marble going down is now going up and because of the gravity it slows down.</p><p>3. the rock hit the ground first because the rock has more mass the the paper and more mass attract gravity more.</p><p>4. It is really important like if where going to make a fire we need a lightstick and we create a friction to make it.</p><p>5. we really need gravity because it's hard to move on a zero gravity like in space if you jump you go forever because no one stops you.</p><br />

                        <p>1. The book is <strong>pulled down by gravity</strong>, yet it doesn't actually fall. Therefore, the book must be propelled up by some force as well.</p><p>2. The marble did not keep slipping. The stone is sliding and slowing down due to <strong>friction.</strong></p><p>3. Since the stone weighs more than the paper, it makes sense that it will fall to the ground first.

Without <strong>gravity</strong>, we would be unable to sustain life on Earth.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Gravity</strong> is a natural phenomenon whereby everything that has mass or energy in the universe—including planets, stars, galaxies, and even light—attracts one another. On earth, <strong>gravity causes </strong>physical objects to have weight, the moon's gravity causes sea tides, and the sun's gravity causes planets and various other objects to be in their respective orbits in the solar system. </p><p>The <strong>gravitational force </strong>of the matter in space that exists in the universe caused this matter to begin to gather, forming stars and causing these stars to gather to form galaxies so that it can be said that the large-scale structures in the universe were created by gravity. <strong>Gravity</strong> has an infinite range of values.

An object sliding across a table or floor slows down due to the net force of </p>friction <p>acting on the object. </p><p>     3. Rock. Because Earth gives everything the same acceleration, objects of varying masses will still hit the ground at the same time if dropped from the same height. </p><p>     4. Friction is the force that opposes any material's relative motion. Friction is required to hold everything in this world together, such as walking, running, driving a vehicle, braking, washing, and wearing clothes.</p><p>     5. We place a high value on gravity. We couldn't exist on this planet without it. The sun's gravity keeps Earth in orbit around it, allowing us to enjoy the sun's light and warmth from a safe distance. It keeps our atmosphere and the air we need to breathe in check.</p>#Goodluck <br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>For example, when a book is placed on a table, the normal force keeps the book from falling through the table. Gravity is pulling the book downward, but since the book isn't actually falling, something must be pushing it up. This force is called the normal force</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>the sliding of the book cannot continue because the friction will slow down the sliding book to stop completely</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Stone </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Friction can slow things down and stop stationary things from moving. In a frictionless world, more objects would be sliding about, clothes and shoes would be difficult to keep on and it would be very difficult for people or cars to get moving or change direction</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Gravity is very important to us. We could not live on Earth without it. The sun's gravity keeps Earth in orbit around it, keeping us at a comfortable distance to enjoy the sun's light and warmth. It holds down our atmosphere and the air we need to breathe.</strong></p><br />
