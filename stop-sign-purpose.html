                                            AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property." Actions such as running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities. The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) and 100 percent improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for "following too closely" or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, "running red light", "improper passing", and "overtaking on the left” topped other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes. Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 percent. Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. "Overtaking on the left" appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it relates to aggressive driving. "Improper lane change," "running stop sign," and "running red light” rank second through four in terms of their contribution to fatalities.QUESTION:1.

Wolf Communication - Part of Wolf Society By: Zack N PaulyThe Big Bad Wolf who threatened the three little pigs the wolf who disguised himself as a grandmother and ate Little Red riding Hood. The story of the little shepherd boy who cried "Wolf!" a lone wolf howling in the moonlight - all these familiar images of the wolf have one thing in common they give a false picture. Contrary to stereotypes born out of human fear, the wolf is not a cold-blooded killer of humans, nor is it a solitary hunter. In fact, wolves are very family-and pack-oriented and have a rich social life, which they maintain by communicating with each other in a variety of interesting ways. These wolf communication behaviors include facial contact, howling, and scent marking. Facial contact behaviors, the most intimate type of wolf communication, closely resemble what humans do when they nuzzle their babies or hug and kiss one another as a greeting. Wolves use nose pushing, cheek rubbing, facial licking, and jaw wrestling to greet one another, to give a friendly welcome, or sometimes to show dominance For example, jaw wrestling - a behavior in which two wolves mouth one another's jaws - can be a greeting or it can be a way of intimidating another, lower-ranking wolf If one wolf puts its mouth over another's muzzle, it is giving a sign of friendship But if the first wolf has its teeth bared, the greeting is not so friendly it is the wolf's way of establishing itself as the more dominant, or more important, member of the wolf pack.Howling is another important way that wolves communicate You may think that wolves howl because they are lonely, but in fact they usually howl for social purposes Barry Lopez, author of the book Of Wolves and Men, says that wolves probably don't howl during a chase, but often do howl after a hunt, "perhaps to celebrate a successful hunt (the presence of food), their prowess, or the fact that they are all together again, that no one has been injured" Wolves howl often during breeding and courtship times (in the winter), and more often in the evening or early morning. However, contrary to popular belief, they don't howl at the moon, and they don't howl any more often when there is a full moon.Wolves also communicate by scent marking. Wolves leave scent marks to define their territory as if to erect an invisible fence that only other wolves with their keen sense of smell can detect. They mark their territory partly for the same reasons that we put our names and initials on our books, mailboxes, sweaters, bracelets - to say, "This is mine." Scent marks help a wolf to know if it is in its own territory. They may even keep a pack together. How exactly do wolves leave scent marks? They urinate, defecate, or scratch the ground every few minutes as they are traveling. And wolves on the move stop every few minutes to inspect scent marks left by other wolves. The more we learn about these and other forms of wolf communication, the better we understand the complex social structure of wolf packs. Perhaps by gaining insight into these magnificent animals - who form enduring relationships, just as humans do we can learn more about ourselves and our place in the world of nature. ​</a>

                                            AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property." Actions such as running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities. The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) and 100 percent improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for "following too closely" or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, "running red light", "improper passing", and "overtaking on the left” topped other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes. Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 percent. Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. "Overtaking on the left" appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it relates to aggressive driving. "Improper lane change," "running stop sign," and "running red light” rank second through four in terms of their contribution to fatalities.QUESTION:1. What is the purpose of the text?

                                            Making the Most of Mucus (part 6)
Just the name itself will make you giggle. It's a great word that conjures visions of slime and unpleasantness. It is perhaps the most annoying part of having a cold or allergies. Mucus, however, plays a very important role in defense of our bodies and our health. In fact, its high time mucus got a lot more respect.
First, there are some amazing facts about mucus that are worthy of respect. Humans produce about a liter of mucus every day, whether they are sick or not. Bony fish and some invertebrates (snails or slugs) also have mucus cells on the outside of their body. This external mucus creates a protective coating that prevents predators' toxins from doing harm. Humans produce mucus to protect our stomachs, our lungs, and several other systems.
We tend to not like mucus because it is a considered a symptom or sign that something is wrong. We usually only see it when we are sick, and so we tend to dislike it. According to Michael M. Johns, III, MD, however, "mucus is incredibly important for our bodies." Johns, an assistant professor at Emory University, calls mucus "the oil in the engine" of our bodies. Without mucus, our engines, or bodies, would freeze up and stop working properly.
Furthermore, mucus is not just the nasty gunk you see when you are sick. It lines the tissues in your mouth, nose, throat, and lungs. It also is crucial in protecting your digestive system. Mucus puts a protective coating over the surfaces of these tissues, keeping them moist. Most of the time we don't notice mucus is making our lives better. It does its job quietly, making everything run smoothly, keeping our inner tissues soft and flexible enough to fight off invaders.
Occasionally, though our mucus-making membranes go into overdrive. If you eat a hot pepper, your mucus membranes in your mouth and throat start producing extra mucus to protect you. If you come into contact with pollen, you may get a runny nose and start sneezing and coughing. When these things happen, your mucus systems start making more fluids to wash away the irritating particles. Mucus also has some antibodies that increase our ability to fight off bacteria and viruses.
It's hard to appreciate what is essentially slime, but we have mucus for some very good reasons. It helps to keep us healthy and lets us know when our bodies are under attack. We would be wise to respect what our bodies do to keep us safe. So the next time you find yourself reaching for a tissue, remember mucus is your friend and ally.
What's in a Name?
Mucus is a great word, not only because it gives a name to an important bodily function, but also because it is one of those words that simultaneously makes you feel grossed-out and giggly. Other words for this powerfully important human-health tool include slime and phlegm. Slang words for mucus include boogers and snot. All of these words have the same giggle-power, simply from the combination of consonants and vowels. By the way, mucus is an old word; it's been around since the mid-1600s and has roots back in Latin (mucere, to be moldy or musty) and Greek (myxa, mucus). While you may assume that words like snot and boogers are relatively new slang terms, they are not. Snot dates to 1560 and comes from an Old English word, gesnot, and has the same root as the word snout. The word booger is not quite as old but has been in use since the 1890s.

Johns, III, MD, however, "mucus is incredibly important for our bodies." Johns, an assistant professor at Emory University, calls mucus "the oil in the engine" of our bodies. Without mucus, our engines, or bodies, would freeze up and stop working properly.
Furthermore, mucus is not just the nasty gunk you see when you are sick. It lines the tissues in your mouth, nose, throat, and lungs. It also is crucial in protecting your digestive system. Mucus puts a protective coating over the surfaces of these tissues, keeping them moist. Most of the time we don't notice mucus is making our lives better. It does its job quietly, making everything run smoothly, keeping our inner tissues soft and flexible enough to fight off invaders.
Occasionally, though our mucus-making membranes go into overdrive. If you eat a hot pepper, your mucus membranes in your mouth and throat start producing extra mucus to protect you. If you come into contact with pollen, you may get a runny nose and start sneezing and coughing. When these things happen, your mucus systems start making more fluids to wash away the irritating particles. Mucus also has some antibodies that increase our ability to fight off bacteria and viruses.
It's hard to appreciate what is essentially slime, but we have mucus for some very good reasons. It helps to keep us healthy and lets us know when our bodies are under attack. We would be wise to respect what our bodies do to keep us safe. So the next time you find yourself reaching for a tissue, remember mucus is your friend and ally.
What's in a Name?
Mucus is a great word, not only because it gives a name to an important bodily function, but also because it is one of those words that simultaneously makes you feel grossed-out and giggly. Other words for this powerfully important human-health tool include slime and phlegm. Slang words for mucus include boogers and snot. All of these words have the same giggle-power, simply from the combination of consonants and vowels. By the way, mucus is an old word; it's been around since the mid-1600s and has roots back in Latin (mucere, to be moldy or musty) and Greek (myxa, mucus). While you may assume that words like snot and boogers are relatively new slang terms, they are not. Snot dates to 1560 and comes from an Old English word, gesnot, and has the same root as the word snout. The word booger is not quite as old but has been in use since the 1890s.

AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED
Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the 
public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines 
aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that 
endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.” Actions such as 
running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane 
change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, 
careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions 
are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided 
because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities.
 The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) 
and 100 percent (improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted 
in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for “ following too closely” 
or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, 
“running red light”, “improper passing”, and “overtaking on the left” topped 
other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes.
 Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by
aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 
percent.
Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. “Overtaking on the left” 
appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it 
relates to aggressive driving. “Improper lane change,” ”running stop sign,” 
and “running red light” rank second through four in terms of their 
contribution to fatalities.

                            6. Read the article below and make an outline using the mapping method. Wolf Communication - Part of Wolf Society By: Zack N PaulyThe Big Bad Wolf who threatened the three little pigs the wolf who disguised himself as a grandmother and ate Little Red riding Hood. The story of the little shepherd boy who cried "Wolf!" a lone wolf howling in the moonlight - all these familiar images of the wolf have one thing in common they give a false picture. Contrary to stereotypes born out of human fear, the wolf is not a cold-blooded killer of humans, nor is it a solitary hunter. In fact, wolves are very family-and pack-oriented and have a rich social life, which they maintain by communicating with each other in a variety of interesting ways. These wolf communication behaviors include facial contact, howling, and scent marking. Facial contact behaviors, the most intimate type of wolf communication, closely resemble what humans do when they nuzzle their babies or hug and kiss one another as a greeting. Wolves use nose pushing, cheek rubbing, facial licking, and jaw wrestling to greet one another, to give a friendly welcome, or sometimes to show dominance For example, jaw wrestling - a behavior in which two wolves mouth one another's jaws - can be a greeting or it can be a way of intimidating another, lower-ranking wolf If one wolf puts its mouth over another's muzzle, it is giving a sign of friendship But if the first wolf has its teeth bared, the greeting is not so friendly it is the wolf's way of establishing itself as the more dominant, or more important, member of the wolf pack.Howling is another important way that wolves communicate You may think that wolves howl because they are lonely, but in fact they usually howl for social purposes Barry Lopez, author of the book Of Wolves and Men, says that wolves probably don't howl during a chase, but often do howl after a hunt, "perhaps to celebrate a successful hunt (the presence of food), their prowess, or the fact that they are all together again, that no one has been injured" Wolves howl often during breeding and courtship times (in the winter), and more often in the evening or early morning. However, contrary to popular belief, they don't howl at the moon, and they don't howl any more often when there is a full moon.Wolves also communicate by scent marking. Wolves leave scent marks to define their territory as if to erect an invisible fence that only other wolves with their keen sense of smell can detect. They mark their territory partly for the same reasons that we put our names and initials on our books, mailboxes, sweaters, bracelets - to say, "This is mine." Scent marks help a wolf to know if it is in its own territory. They may even keep a pack together. How exactly do wolves leave scent marks? They urinate, defecate, or scratch the ground every few minutes as they are traveling. And wolves on the move stop every few minutes to inspect scent marks left by other wolves. The more we learn about these and other forms of wolf communication, the better we understand the complex social structure of wolf packs. Perhaps by gaining insight into these magnificent animals - who form enduring relationships, just as humans do we can learn more about ourselves and our place in the world of nature. ​</h2><br />

According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) and 100 percent improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for "following too closely" or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, "running red light", "improper passing", and "overtaking on the left” topped other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes. Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 percent. Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. "Overtaking on the left" appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it relates to aggressive driving. "Improper lane change," "running stop sign," and "running red light” rank second through four in terms of their contribution to fatalities.QUESTION:1. What is the purpose of the text?

                            15. Making the Most of Mucus (part 6)
Just the name itself will make you giggle. It's a great word that conjures visions of slime and unpleasantness. It is perhaps the most annoying part of having a cold or allergies. Mucus, however, plays a very important role in defense of our bodies and our health. In fact, its high time mucus got a lot more respect.
First, there are some amazing facts about mucus that are worthy of respect. Humans produce about a liter of mucus every day, whether they are sick or not. Bony fish and some invertebrates (snails or slugs) also have mucus cells on the outside of their body. This external mucus creates a protective coating that prevents predators' toxins from doing harm. Humans produce mucus to protect our stomachs, our lungs, and several other systems.
We tend to not like mucus because it is a considered a symptom or sign that something is wrong. We usually only see it when we are sick, and so we tend to dislike it. According to Michael M. Johns, III, MD, however, "mucus is incredibly important for our bodies." Johns, an assistant professor at Emory University, calls mucus "the oil in the engine" of our bodies. Without mucus, our engines, or bodies, would freeze up and stop working properly.
Furthermore, mucus is not just the nasty gunk you see when you are sick. It lines the tissues in your mouth, nose, throat, and lungs. It also is crucial in protecting your digestive system. Mucus puts a protective coating over the surfaces of these tissues, keeping them moist. Most of the time we don't notice mucus is making our lives better. It does its job quietly, making everything run smoothly, keeping our inner tissues soft and flexible enough to fight off invaders.
Occasionally, though our mucus-making membranes go into overdrive. If you eat a hot pepper, your mucus membranes in your mouth and throat start producing extra mucus to protect you. If you come into contact with pollen, you may get a runny nose and start sneezing and coughing. When these things happen, your mucus systems start making more fluids to wash away the irritating particles. Mucus also has some antibodies that increase our ability to fight off bacteria and viruses.
It's hard to appreciate what is essentially slime, but we have mucus for some very good reasons. It helps to keep us healthy and lets us know when our bodies are under attack. We would be wise to respect what our bodies do to keep us safe. So the next time you find yourself reaching for a tissue, remember mucus is your friend and ally.
What's in a Name?
Mucus is a great word, not only because it gives a name to an important bodily function, but also because it is one of those words that simultaneously makes you feel grossed-out and giggly. Other words for this powerfully important human-health tool include slime and phlegm. Slang words for mucus include boogers and snot. All of these words have the same giggle-power, simply from the combination of consonants and vowels. By the way, mucus is an old word; it's been around since the mid-1600s and has roots back in Latin (mucere, to be moldy or musty) and Greek (myxa, mucus). While you may assume that words like snot and boogers are relatively new slang terms, they are not. Snot dates to 1560 and comes from an Old English word, gesnot, and has the same root as the word snout. The word booger is not quite as old but has been in use since the 1890s.

 Circle the letter of the correct answer.
AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED
Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the 
public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines 
aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that 
endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.” Actions such as 
running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane 
change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, 
careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions 
are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided 
because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities.
 The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) 
and 100 percent (improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted 
in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for “ following too closely” 
or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, 
“running red light”, “improper passing”, and “overtaking on the left” topped 
other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes.
 Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by
aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 
percent.
Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. “Overtaking on the left” 
appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it 
relates to aggressive driving. “Improper lane change,” ”running stop sign,” 
and “running red light” rank second through four in terms of their 
contribution to fatalities.
