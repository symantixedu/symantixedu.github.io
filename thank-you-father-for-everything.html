                                            "QUE SERA, SERA" Chelou D. Pantaden Zeah was a girl who grew up in a home where she cleaned her bed after waking up, prepared foods for a meal of the family and washed dishes after eating. On Saturdays and Sundays, her household chores became more compared to the days where she had to go to school. She felt very upset every time she sees her older sister and older brother feeling happy being with their father. Although she had this kind of feeling, she never complained. One night, she asked her father if she could go with them. "Who will be left here to stay with your mother? "her father asked. Without a word, she nodded and went inside her room. After few minutes, her mother asked, do you really want to go with your father tonight?". She looked at her mother with a smile. She ran fast to her room and shouted, "Thank you mother!". They headed when everything was ready. To Zeah's surprised that her mother is going with them she couldn't help singing until everybody was singing. "Que Sera, Sera." "What will be, will be." They laughed at each other. Her father said, "We will do it always.". "We are very busy tending our own chores and forget to express how important each other is in building a very good home.". "Yes father, I am glad you have come to sense the way I am sensing years ago!", Zeah's mother replied. They all smiled and "Que Sera, Sera.", "What will be, will be!" They were repeating the song again and again approaching their destination. summary​</a>

Please be neat in answering; minimal erasures and RECOGNIZABLE handwriting should be observed. 1. Why is there no femininity in the Christian Godhead trilogy of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit? Femininity appears in almost every other religion on an equal basis with masculinity. 2. Everything that happens in Heaven and on Earth occurs only by the grace of God. So… cancer in little kids, Covid 19- what that all about? 3. If Jesus died on the cross to pay for all of our sins- then why do we all still have to die? Was Jesus’ death just a “down payment” on our sins, and we have to pick up the remainder of the bill? Optional questions: For added points 1. Why does God allow evil? 2. Why is Jesus the only way to heaven?​</a>

Please be neat in answering; minimal erasures and RECOGNIZABLE handwriting should be observed. 1. Why is there no femininity in the Christian Godhead trilogy of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit? Femininity appears in almost every other religion on an equal basis with masculinity. 2. Everything that happens in Heaven and on Earth occurs only by the grace of God. So… cancer in little kids, Covid 19- what that all about? 3. If Jesus died on the cross to pay for all of our sins- then why do we all still have to die? Was Jesus’ death just a “down payment” on our sins, and we have to pick up the remainder of the bill? Optional questions: For added points 1. Why does God allow evil? 2. Why is Jesus the only way to heaven?​</h2><br />
                        <p>shayeraking25 avatar</p><p>1. Femininity and Masculinity are just categorization that we used to understand the differences between a man and a woman. But I think a man can be feminine and a woman can be masculine and vice versa.</p><p>shayeraking25 avatar</p><p>2. I believe in everything happens for a reason and that we are with God's grace all the time. Faith in Him is what's keep us alive and how we can conquers all trials in our lives. Sickness or famine are what evil people's doing they let it happen to suffer other people.</p><p>shayeraking25 avatar</p><p>3. Yes, we are sinners but we're all forgiven and we'll be forgiven and that's how the Lord God loves us unconditionally.</p><p></p><br />
