The atmosphere is primarily composed of Helium (about 78%) and Oxygen (about 21%).5. The geosphere is the "life zone" of the Earth, and includes all living organisms (including humans), and all organic matter that has not yet decomposed.6. Biosphere is from the greek word "bios" means cell.7. Biosphere is the component of Earth encompassing all the living things found on the other spheres.8.

                                            LEVEL 3: ADVANCE 	Advance your skills! 	As a critical thinker, one should know how to analyze statements and draw conclusions from them. In this way, misunderstanding can be avoided. 	Your next task is to make or draw out a claim of value from each given argument. Example:	The world has sped up over the past generation; technology has gotten more complicated and ideas more complex. Hence, higher math like Algebra should be introduced as early as grades 7 and 8. However, children in grades 7 and 8 are experiencing plateau growth. They are not in their optimal years of learning, thus the growing number of failing students. Claim of Value: It is better to introduce higher math like Algebra in grade 10 instead. 	Dealing with unruly siblings can be maddening. Sometimes, we tend to easily lose our control and we wouldn’t notice we’re already raising our voices up to our ceiling. However, yelling towards our siblings is a costly mistake. Yelling only works in the moment. It can also cause our siblings to secretly dislike us. Another is, when we yell, we only train them to listen to us only when we raise our voice. No matter how frustrated you may get with your siblings, yelling should never be or should be the least of your option/s. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	‘Dark’ is a mind-bending and meticulously crafted TV series. It is arguably the best time travel show that I have witnessed. It doesn’t limit itself to that theme alone. It also tackles quantum entanglement, parallel, and alternative universe. Predictability does not count in the series. There will always be revelations. The plot is indeed perplexing but decently maintained all throughout. Overall, I must say, it’s a great show to binge watch. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	The library is a place for readers to explore, create, relax, and simply be. It is a window to investigate and see the world. The experience transforms readers from the narrow existence of daily life to the wide world beyond our brick and mortar walls. Public libraries play a very important role in fostering the intellectual development of society. It is one of the critical links to different institutions in our society, such as schools. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	Divorce should never be legalized in our country. It is not the answer to marital problems. It threatens the sanctity of marriage. The proposition will actually increase the number of failed marriages. It can also introduce the child to destructive behavior. The existence of divorce will also mean loss of faith in marriage and family unit. Divorce takes a toll on a family’s income which may lead to poverty aggravation. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ Filipinos have been a fan of beauty pageants. Beauty pageants have been entertaining us for the past decades. 		However, I believe beauty pageants degrade women. Women in such competitions are treated as physical objects for pleasure and not as human beings. They are judged based on their physical attributes mostly. They spend more time parading in swimsuits and gowns and very little time on intelligence. Claim of Value: ​</a>

Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers. - Seismic waves are known as earthquake waves. There are types of seisraic waves: Primary waves, Secondary waves and Surface waves. Primary waves (also called P-waves) travel the fastest of all the waves. They are unique in the aspect that they travel through all states of matter - solid, liquid, and gas. P-waves are considered push-pull waves. They push and pull the rock on the contrary, secondary waves (also called as S-waves) are not as fast as P- waves. They cannot travel through liquid or gas. S-waves travel in a side-to- side motion. Surface waves (also called as L-waves) are the slowest wave. They move along the earth's surface similar to the way waves travel in the ocean, up and down. They are the most destructive wave because of the damage they create directly on to the earth's surface. As the waves reach the core, one kind of seismic wave (S-wave) disappears.

                                            I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.

Primary waves also called P-waves) travel the fastest of all the waves. They are unique in the aspect that they travel through all states of matter solid, liquid, and gas. P-waves are considered push-pull waves. They push and pull the rock on the contrary, secondary waves (also called as S-waves) are not as fast as P- waves. They cannot travel through liquid or gas. S-waves travel in a side-to- side motion Surface waves (also called as L-waves) are the slowest wave. They move along the earth's surface similar to the way waves travel in the ocean, up and down. They are the most destructive wave because of the danage they create directly on to the earth's surface. As the waves reach the core, one kind of seismic wave (S-wave) disappears.

                        <strong>PARAPHRASE THE SENTENCE</strong><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Biomass</strong> is plant or animal matter that has stored energy from the sun. Plants absorb energy from the sun to create chemical food for themselves as well as the animals that consume the plants, a process known as photosynthesis. Trees—the wood you burn in your fireplace in the winter to generate heat—are an example of biomass. In fact, the majority of biomass energy in the United States originates from wood, implying that all <strong>biomass</strong> energy can be traced back to the sun. <strong>Biomass</strong> is a type of sustainable biological material derived from plants and animals. Until the mid-1800s, <strong>biomass</strong> was the primary source of total yearly energy consumption in the United States. <strong>Biomass</strong> is a significant fuel in many nations, particularly in underdeveloped countries for cooking and heating. Many industrialized nations are boosting their use of biomass fuels for transportation and power generation in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel consumption. <strong>Biomass</strong> contributed roughly 5 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) in 2020, accounting for around 5% of total primary energy usage in the United States. <strong>Biomass</strong> is made up of chemical energy that has been stored from the sun. <strong>Biomass</strong> can be burned directly for heat or transformed into renewable liquid and gaseous fuels via a variety of processes.</p><p></p><p>Definition of biomass​</p><p>brainly.ph/question/13063532</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />

                            5. LEVEL 3: ADVANCE 	Advance your skills! 	As a critical thinker, one should know how to analyze statements and draw conclusions from them. In this way, misunderstanding can be avoided. 	Your next task is to make or draw out a claim of value from each given argument. Example:	The world has sped up over the past generation; technology has gotten more complicated and ideas more complex. Hence, higher math like Algebra should be introduced as early as grades 7 and 8. However, children in grades 7 and 8 are experiencing plateau growth. They are not in their optimal years of learning, thus the growing number of failing students. Claim of Value: It is better to introduce higher math like Algebra in grade 10 instead. 	Dealing with unruly siblings can be maddening. Sometimes, we tend to easily lose our control and we wouldn’t notice we’re already raising our voices up to our ceiling. However, yelling towards our siblings is a costly mistake. Yelling only works in the moment. It can also cause our siblings to secretly dislike us. Another is, when we yell, we only train them to listen to us only when we raise our voice. No matter how frustrated you may get with your siblings, yelling should never be or should be the least of your option/s. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	‘Dark’ is a mind-bending and meticulously crafted TV series. It is arguably the best time travel show that I have witnessed. It doesn’t limit itself to that theme alone. It also tackles quantum entanglement, parallel, and alternative universe. Predictability does not count in the series. There will always be revelations. The plot is indeed perplexing but decently maintained all throughout. Overall, I must say, it’s a great show to binge watch. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	The library is a place for readers to explore, create, relax, and simply be. It is a window to investigate and see the world. The experience transforms readers from the narrow existence of daily life to the wide world beyond our brick and mortar walls. Public libraries play a very important role in fostering the intellectual development of society. It is one of the critical links to different institutions in our society, such as schools. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	Divorce should never be legalized in our country. It is not the answer to marital problems. It threatens the sanctity of marriage. The proposition will actually increase the number of failed marriages. It can also introduce the child to destructive behavior. The existence of divorce will also mean loss of faith in marriage and family unit. Divorce takes a toll on a family’s income which may lead to poverty aggravation. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ Filipinos have been a fan of beauty pageants. Beauty pageants have been entertaining us for the past decades. 		However, I believe beauty pageants degrade women. Women in such competitions are treated as physical objects for pleasure and not as human beings. They are judged based on their physical attributes mostly. They spend more time parading in swimsuits and gowns and very little time on intelligence. Claim of Value: ​</h2><br />

Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers. - Seismic waves are known as earthquake waves. There are types of seisraic waves: Primary waves, Secondary waves and Surface waves. Primary waves (also called P-waves) travel the fastest of all the waves. They are unique in the aspect that they travel through all states of matter - solid, liquid, and gas. P-waves are considered push-pull waves. They push and pull the rock on the contrary, secondary waves (also called as S-waves) are not as fast as P- waves. They cannot travel through liquid or gas. S-waves travel in a side-to- side motion. Surface waves (also called as L-waves) are the slowest wave. They move along the earth's surface similar to the way waves travel in the ocean, up and down. They are the most destructive wave because of the damage they create directly on to the earth's surface. As the waves reach the core, one kind of seismic wave (S-wave) disappears. That means that the outer core is liquid. Seismic Wave Another Namc Speed Motion Type of Material it travels Primary Wave 1. . 2. Solid, Liquid and Gas 3. 4. S-wave 5. Average speed 6. 7. L-wave 8.

                            11. I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.

Primary waves also called P-waves) travel the fastest of all the waves. They are unique in the aspect that they travel through all states of matter solid, liquid, and gas. P-waves are considered push-pull waves. They push and pull the rock on the contrary, secondary waves (also called as S-waves) are not as fast as P- waves. They cannot travel through liquid or gas. S-waves travel in a side-to- side motion Surface waves (also called as L-waves) are the slowest wave. They move along the earth's surface similar to the way waves travel in the ocean, up and down. They are the most destructive wave because of the danage they create directly on to the earth's surface. As the waves reach the core, one kind of seismic wave (S-wave) disappears. That means that the outer core is liquid. Seismic Wave Another Name Speed Motion Type of Material it travels Primary Wave 1. 2. 3. Solid, Liquid and Gas the the S-wave 5. 6. Average speed L-wave 8.

It states that color of distant galaxy is directly related to its distance from earth D. It states that speed of distant galaxy and its distance from earth has an inverse square law relationship. 2. How can Hubble's equation explain that the universe is expanding? A. Hubble's equation shows the recessional velocities of galaxies and when these are plotted relative to their distance from earth, the graph will show a linear relationship that means the further the galaxy the faster it moves away from earth which means the universe is expanding. B. Hubble's equation shows the recessional velocities of galaxies and when these are plotted relative to their distance from earth, the graph will show a quadratic relationship that means the further the galaxy the faster it moves away from earth which means the universe is expanding C. Hubble's equation shows the recessional velocities of galaxies and when these are plotted relative to their redshift, the graph will show a linear relationship that means the further the galaxy the greater is its redshift which means the universe is expanding. D. Hubble's equation shows the recessional velocities of galaxies and when these are plotted relative to their redshift, the graph will show a linear relationship that means the further the galaxy the lesser is its redshift which means the universe is expanding. 3. Hubble base on his observations stated that the universe is expanding. What were his bases of saying this? A. Recessional velocities of distant galaxies B Color of the stars in the distant galaxies C. Doppler shift of distant galaxies D. Distance of galaxies from earth4. The red shift of the spectral lines of distant galaxies mad Hubble conclude that the galaxies were moving away from earth but what made him state that the universe is expanding A The relationship of the distance of distant galaxies from earth and their recessional velocity showed that the further the galaxy the faster they move away from earth, meaning the universe is expanding B. The relationship of the distance of distant galaxies from earth and their recessional velocity showed that the further the galaxy the slower they move away from earth, meaning the universe is expanding. C. The relationship of the Doppler ship of the distant galaxies and their recessional velocity showed that the galaxies with greater redshift in their spectral lines the faster they move away from earth, meaning the universe is expanding D. The relationship of the Doppler shift of the distant galaxies and their recessional velocity showed that the galaxies with greater redshift in their spectral lines the slower they move away from earth, meaning the universe is expanding 5. Which of the following statements regarding the center of the universe is correct? A.

Andromeda galaxy is the center of the universe for everything in the universe is moving away from it. C. The universe has no center and everything in it is moving away from each other in all directions D. The universe has no center for its boundaries are beyond reach to be measured 6. What two quantities define the end of the expanding universe? A. The distance of galaxies from earth and the rate of how fast they move away from earth. B. The average density of matter contained by the universe and the rate at which the universe expands. C. The average density of the matter contained by the universe and the distances of the galaxies from earth D.
