If false, write the word FALSE and change the underlinedword to make the statement correct.1. Confucianism started as a philosophy that would pro-vide a solution to China's chaotic society during the Shang dynasty.2. Confucianism was adopted by the Han dynasty as aninstrument for its political legitimacy.3. Daoism believes that nature should be allowed totake its natural course for the attainment of social order.4. Shintoism emphasized the core values of family, tra-dition, nature, ancestors, purity, and ritual practices.5. Laozi believed that what makes us human is ourfeeling of sympathy for other's suffering, but what makes us virtu-ous is our cultivation of this inner potential6, In Shinto, pollution is inevitable but can be washedaway by proper meditation,7. In Confucianism, destiny can only be achieved whenone has cultivated oneself to the highest potential that one's ac-tions go effortlessly with the way of the universe.8. The Dao is considered as the "mother of all things”and playing the feminine part is a constant theme in Daoism.9. A normative interpretation of ming sees destiny as adistant force beyond human control.10. In Confucianism, a woman's life revolves aroundobeying men---her father, her husband, and her brother​</a>

The first sentence is incorrect and the second sentence is correct. D. Both sentences are incorrect. 1. Law of Conservation of Mass states that the total quantity of mass of substance remains constant regardless of any change that takes place. The mass of the reactants must be equal to the mass products. 2. Coefficients are whole numbers written in front of the symbols or formula. Equations can be balanced by inspection, a trial-and-error process. 3. Rate of reaction refers to the speed at which reactant either decompose or combine to form new substances. Chemical reactions have the same characteristics and require different conditions to proceed. 4. Decreasing the temperature speeds up the reacting particles. Reducing the particle size of solid reactants increases the surface area available for collision 5. Concentration refers to the number of particles of substance in a given volume. As reactant concentration is increased, more particles will most likely collide. 6. In a catalyzed reaction, the catalyst is not actually consumed in one step and regenerated next. In effect, it will never use over and over again but is not consumed in the reaction. 7. Many biological and industrial process depend in catalytic procedures. Living things, especially humans, rely on natural catalysts known as enzymes. 8. Spark or friction can also increase the energy of a system and help and generate the activation energy. All reactions have a high activation energy and thus have to be heated to a certain temperature. 9. The subscripts can be changed. Coefficients are the only one to be adjusted. 10. When we have exactly the same number of each atom on each side of the equation, we say that the chemical equation is balanced. An equation is not correct until it is balanced.​</a>

One of the best ways to do this is to learn new skills, whether it is for personal development or for an opportunity of finding a better career. To be able to do this, one can attend training programs which provide fresh knowledge; learn new skills on his present job with the help of his co-workers; be open to supervisors/ colleagues for coaching and mentoring; read new developments, trends, and innovations that are related to one's job; and join forums on-line which will provide a wider source of newer information relating to one's job or profession. Upgrading one's knowledge and skills is beneficial as it helps in increasing a person's self-confidence, improves competitiveness leading to a greater chance of being hired or promoted, develops creativeness which contributes to productiveness, and opens doors for better and wider career opportunities. Most jobs today are adapting to the changes that is brought by technological trends and advancement. Thus, one must also be able to adapt and be up-to-date with the developments and trends that has something to do with their job. II.

Education is important to the children, to adults and to the society. Education gives people knowledge of the world around them and changes it into something better. It develops in people a perspective of looking at life, helps them build opinions and have points of view on things in life. Mahatma Gandhi once quoted, "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." This portrays the importance of education and leaming in one's life. If a child is joined in a school, he will start leaming, playing and enjoy with friends. While leaming he will understand what position he is in acquiring knowledge and he will leam slowly to grab the top position. While playing he will understand the logic to win it; this way they start building goals at an early stage. But parents should understand whether their children are working only for ranks and grades or acquiring some wisdom or not. It is important that they are aware of the purpose of education and how it works in real life. They start maintaining a structured life. To an individual, education increases the level of confidence as it makes a person aware about his/her surroundings. It also helps an individual to communicate better and express his/her opinions.

Education provides a platform for a decent livelihood. One can take up a job in industry or another professional service if he/she is educated. Advances in medicine, war equipment, technology were possible due to constant exploration and research. People of current age carry this exploration. They could do so due to their education and knowledge about the past technology. People with higher education in science, mathematics, and technology can do this. The food production, medicine, electronic gadgets, automobiles and other luxury items were developed due to the spread of science and technology among the professionals through studies. To be a better human, an active participant in society and to gain respect from the world one should always learn new things. Leaming new things in education.

All living things show motion viaereas non- living things show motion onlywhen force asts on them.2.Galileo inferred that objects in vacuum fall with constant acceleration3. Aristotie had the idea that heavier object fall faster than lighter objects.4. In Galileo's ezperimentation using two different weights of ball droppingin the leaning Pisa tower, he proves that heavier and lighter object fall at thesame time provided that there is no air resistance. Fe also measures theacceleration,5. Freely falling bodies undergo constant acceleration.6. Motion is constantly changing7. Galileo used an inclined ramp in order to measure acceleration.8. When the object, is changing position with respect to its surrounding with agiven time it is called motion.9. In measuring motion, point of reference is considered.10. According to Aristotle, free- fall undergoes constant acceleration.​</h2><br />

Choose the letter of your answer from the given statements. A. Both sentences are correct B. The first sentence is correct and the second sentence is incorrect. C. The first sentence is incorrect and the second sentence is correct. D. Both sentences are incorrect. 1. Law of Conservation of Mass states that the total quantity of mass of substance remains constant regardless of any change that takes place. The mass of the reactants must be equal to the mass products. 2. Coefficients are whole numbers written in front of the symbols or formula. Equations can be balanced by inspection, a trial-and-error process. 3. Rate of reaction refers to the speed at which reactant either decompose or combine to form new substances. Chemical reactions have the same characteristics and require different conditions to proceed. 4. Decreasing the temperature speeds up the reacting particles. Reducing the particle size of solid reactants increases the surface area available for collision 5. Concentration refers to the number of particles of substance in a given volume. As reactant concentration is increased, more particles will most likely collide. 6. In a catalyzed reaction, the catalyst is not actually consumed in one step and regenerated next. In effect, it will never use over and over again but is not consumed in the reaction. 7. Many biological and industrial process depend in catalytic procedures. Living things, especially humans, rely on natural catalysts known as enzymes. 8. Spark or friction can also increase the energy of a system and help and generate the activation energy. All reactions have a high activation energy and thus have to be heated to a certain temperature. 9. The subscripts can be changed. Coefficients are the only one to be adjusted. 10. When we have exactly the same number of each atom on each side of the equation, we say that the chemical equation is balanced. An equation is not correct until it is balanced.​</h2><br />

Education is important to the children, to adults and to the society. Education gives people knowledge of the world around them and changes it into something better. It develops in people a perspective of looking at life, helps them build opinions and have points of view on things in life. Mahatma Gandhi once quoted, "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." This portrays the importance of education and leaming in one's life. If a child is joined in a school, he will start leaming, playing and enjoy with friends. While leaming he will understand what position he is in acquiring knowledge and he will leam slowly to grab the top position. While playing he will understand the logic to win it; this way they start building goals at an early stage. But parents should understand whether their children are working only for ranks and grades or acquiring some wisdom or not. It is important that they are aware of the purpose of education and how it works in real life. They start maintaining a structured life. To an individual, education increases the level of confidence as it makes a person aware about his/her surroundings. It also helps an individual to communicate better and express his/her opinions. The mind gets matured by proper education and training. A person can judge what is right and what is not. Education makes a person independent and helps him abide by the rules of the land. Education improves the standard of living of Written by: CLARIBEL C. BUENAVENTURA 3 the people. It helps people understand their needs and gives them the way to acquire them. Education provides a platform for a decent livelihood. One can take up a job in industry or another professional service if he/she is educated. Advances in medicine, war equipment, technology were possible due to constant exploration and research. People of current age carry this exploration. They could do so due to their education and knowledge about the past technology. People with higher education in science, mathematics, and technology can do this. The food production, medicine, electronic gadgets, automobiles and other luxury items were developed due to the spread of science and technology among the professionals through studies. To be a better human, an active participant in society and to gain respect from the world one should always learn new things. Leaming new things in education.
