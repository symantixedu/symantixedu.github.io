                                            I was an engineer in the new tech center '95-'97. I setup a lot of it. I worked 7 months in Toledo while training before we made the big move to Goldsboro. Lived in a hotel the entire time. Got to meet Benny Parsons while in Toledo when he visited the Tech Center. He was a super nice guy. Four of us were fresh out of college. We had a blast. I remember experimenting with a new onboard dyno module on a Typhoon (turbo awd blazer) and a Cobra mustang. I remember when I was ready to test the Typhoon, everyone wanted a ride. We had every seat filled. Jim Gerber(plant manager?) then came up and wanted a ride also. He actually jumped in the hatch area. I pulled out onto Dixie Trail, hollered "hang on" and punched the throttle. I looked in the rear view mirror and Jim was plastered against the rear hatch window. Thought I killed the plant manager for a moment LOL. I won't mention the guy's name who would moon the other guys in the shop from the windows that overlooked the shop area. I have more stories that I may tell later. If you know Dan Jones, he can tell you more I'm sure. I'll never forget the day of the big company wide meeting when the president said the company couldn't afford the lay anyone off but couldn't afford our pay either so they gave everyone a 10% pay cut. I remember at least three of us immediately going back to our desk and updating our resumes. Another engineer and I had new jobs about a month later. Had a great time and made a lot of friends during my short time at AP. I still have a few of the AP contingency decals that were NASCAR cars.</a>

She had an impressive academic credentials when she was still studying. She was appointed to various government positions. She combatted syndicates and illegal aliens. As a senator, she made several notable laws that she authored/co-authored including the Magna Carta for Women, Cyber Crime Act of 2012, Reproductive Health Act of 2012, Climate Change Act of 2009 and many more. She wrote more than 30 books, which became famous and touched the hearts even of the Filipino youth of today.

                                            “We are confronted with what is perhaps the most challenging chapter in contemporary Philippine history. COVID-19 continues to cripple the world in ways that seemed unimaginable, yet are now painfully unfolding right before our very eyes. Even economies of the world perceived to be strong and stable have been shocked, and shaken, by this disease. COVID-19's aftermath is a reality to be feared as well. Amidst all the chaos and confusion, amidst the seemingly gloomy search for an antidote, and despite the resounding call for national solidarity and cooperation, there are those who still manage to malign the integrity and commitment of the Senate in advancing the country and the people's ultimate good. The Senate has been accused of doing nothing, of failing to rise and serve the people at a time when they needed their leaders the most. Such statements are unjust and disheartening, Mr. President. If I alone had been the target of these attacks, Mr. President, I should not take a moment of the Senate's valuable time today, but I believe that other Senators who have been unjustly and wilfully assailed, hold the same attitude upon this that I do. The reckless provocations, fake news, most often for pettiest and personal reasons - not having to do whatsoever with the role of a Senator in the current Coronavirus crisis- should never be regarded as new normal. We should never allow purveyors of fake news and vested interest to desecrate the Senate as an institution. The Philippine Senate holds the distinction of remaining open, with our adoption of hybrid proceedings by virtue of P.S. Reso. No. 372, while other legislatures in other countries - with all due respect, China, Madagascar, Czech Republic, Malaysia, and Mexico - have remained closed. I rise today, in recognition of the efforts and sacrifices made by our colleagues here in the midst of the pandemic. Three of our colleagues were affected Covid 19 and 20 staff were tested positive. Lastly, I rise today, to give a highlight of the accomplishments of our colleagues, starting with the landmark measure that laid down the framework for the recovery and rehabilitation of the country.”--- Senator Francis Tolentino , May 6,2020.Honesty:Use of Language:Citation:Speech goals:Description/Interpretation;Pa helps po please...​</a>

                            7. I was an engineer in the new tech center '95-'97. I setup a lot of it. I worked 7 months in Toledo while training before we made the big move to Goldsboro. Lived in a hotel the entire time. Got to meet Benny Parsons while in Toledo when he visited the Tech Center. He was a super nice guy. Four of us were fresh out of college. We had a blast. I remember experimenting with a new onboard dyno module on a Typhoon (turbo awd blazer) and a Cobra mustang. I remember when I was ready to test the Typhoon, everyone wanted a ride. We had every seat filled. Jim Gerber(plant manager?) then came up and wanted a ride also. He actually jumped in the hatch area. I pulled out onto Dixie Trail, hollered "hang on" and punched the throttle. I looked in the rear view mirror and Jim was plastered against the rear hatch window. Thought I killed the plant manager for a moment LOL. I won't mention the guy's name who would moon the other guys in the shop from the windows that overlooked the shop area. I have more stories that I may tell later. If you know Dan Jones, he can tell you more I'm sure. I'll never forget the day of the big company wide meeting when the president said the company couldn't afford the lay anyone off but couldn't afford our pay either so they gave everyone a 10% pay cut. I remember at least three of us immediately going back to our desk and updating our resumes. Another engineer and I had new jobs about a month later. Had a great time and made a lot of friends during my short time at AP. I still have a few of the AP contingency decals that were NASCAR cars.</h2><br />

CategoryIn the News·         Date PublishedJan 09, 2023National Achievement Test for Grade 12 students setMANILA, Philippines — Grade 12 students from public and private schools will be taking the National Achievement Test (NAT) by the end of the month.In a memorandum released on Jan. 5, Education Undersecretary Epimaco Densing said the exit assessment, which was designed to be “progressive in nature,” would be administered on Jan. 30 and Jan. 31.“DepEd has to identify and articulate indicators and targets for measuring performance in the development of plans and policies,” he said.The test results will serve as data and evidence in improving the implementation of the curriculum, as well as evidence-based decision-making.According to Densing, the test items would measure varying levels of skills through a multiple-choice paper-based format.“It is designed to determine if graduating learners are meeting the learning standard in the senior high school (SHS) curriculum,” he said.The NAT result will also give insight into the percentage of Grade 12 students who have the minimum level of proficiency in the fourth stage of the SHS core areas.The test will cover 21st-century skills and the primary learning topics in SHS including languages, humanities, communication, mathematics, science, social science, and philosophy.An online national orientation was held on Jan. 6 to issue the specific guidelines for the test administration and the tasks of field-testing personnel and download of program support funds by the schools’ division office.In a study published last year, the government think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) pointed out that failure to let the public know about the NAT results had contributed to the ongoing education crisis.“Even though we continuously administer national achievement tests, the results are never granularly available for in-depth analysis and even less public discussion,” said the report authored by PIDS president Aniceto Orbeta Jr. and research fellow vicente paqueo help!!​</h2><br />

                            13. “We are confronted with what is perhaps the most challenging chapter in contemporary Philippine history. COVID-19 continues to cripple the world in ways that seemed unimaginable, yet are now painfully unfolding right before our very eyes. Even economies of the world perceived to be strong and stable have been shocked, and shaken, by this disease. COVID-19's aftermath is a reality to be feared as well. Amidst all the chaos and confusion, amidst the seemingly gloomy search for an antidote, and despite the resounding call for national solidarity and cooperation, there are those who still manage to malign the integrity and commitment of the Senate in advancing the country and the people's ultimate good. The Senate has been accused of doing nothing, of failing to rise and serve the people at a time when they needed their leaders the most. Such statements are unjust and disheartening, Mr. President. If I alone had been the target of these attacks, Mr. President, I should not take a moment of the Senate's valuable time today, but I believe that other Senators who have been unjustly and wilfully assailed, hold the same attitude upon this that I do. The reckless provocations, fake news, most often for pettiest and personal reasons - not having to do whatsoever with the role of a Senator in the current Coronavirus crisis- should never be regarded as new normal. We should never allow purveyors of fake news and vested interest to desecrate the Senate as an institution. The Philippine Senate holds the distinction of remaining open, with our adoption of hybrid proceedings by virtue of P.S. Reso. No. 372, while other legislatures in other countries - with all due respect, China, Madagascar, Czech Republic, Malaysia, and Mexico - have remained closed. I rise today, in recognition of the efforts and sacrifices made by our colleagues here in the midst of the pandemic. Three of our colleagues were affected Covid 19 and 20 staff were tested positive. Lastly, I rise today, to give a highlight of the accomplishments of our colleagues, starting with the landmark measure that laid down the framework for the recovery and rehabilitation of the country.”--- Senator Francis Tolentino , May 6,2020.Honesty:Use of Language:Citation:Speech goals:Description/Interpretation;Pa helps po please...​</h2><br />
