                                            NO NONSENSE ANSWERS PLEASE! SPEECH PATTERNS PREP=Point, Reason, Example, Point● Use the PREP pattern to make a point. You can either agree or disagree with the topic or opinion. By wrapping up with a restatement of your point, you ensure that your speech is tightly structured.2. PPF= Past, Present, Future● Use the PPF when you want to share an opinion or situation that changes over time. Sharing anecdotes in this form will help your audience follow your story (and speech) easily.3.SMC= Story, Message, Call to action. ● When you want to sell an idea or convince your audience to take action, use this pattern. Close your speech with force, and you will have the world in the palm of your hands.Structure your speech- Your speech is composed mainly of the 3 essential elements: Introduction-Body and Conclusion.A. Introduction- this part is the attention getter/grabber, highly engaging and motivational. Your aim is to tell your audience who you are and what you’re talking about. In order to grab their attention, your greeting must be creative and make a great opening statement. Make it catchy, appealing, or captivating. It is also the part where the thesis statement is found. You may use any of the following techniques:● A rhetorical question- A question requiring no answer; however, it makes the audience think. This way, your audience are being hooked. Example: “I’m here to talk to you about what ordinary people can do to fight against climate change. Why? Because we’re running out of time to act.”● A surprising statement- Surprise is a powerful tool in any speech. It makes your audience sit up and pay attention.● A famous quote- line/s said by credible/well-known persons. Example: Former VP Binay once said, “Education is the great equalizer.”B. Body - it is where you present your arguments with several main points that include objection handling. Divide this main body into 2-3 points and separate each point into different paragraphs. C. Conclusion-A good conclusion takes everything you said and sums it up. Something that is memorable and calls your audience into action.​</a>

                                            POWER IN POWERLESSNESS The late former President Cory Aquino and her son Noynoy, at their Times Street residence in February 2006, heatedly debated her resolve to intercede during the Marine standoff at the then Fort Bonifacio. Noynoy, on whose lap fell the responsibility of looking after his mother after his father Ninoy was assassinated, was determined to keep her out of the fray, especially then when she was no longer president. Cory, however, remained obstinate as she unequivocally expressed her determination to proceed to Fort Bonifactio. Noynoy vehemently tried to dissuade her, citing grave danger and the volatility of the situation there. Furthermore, he wamed that those inside Fort Bonifacio were not exactly friendly forces and those outside were no less hostile than those besieged. But Cory stuck to her guns and declared, "Everything is simple. My duty is to avert bloodshed at all cost. Help me." Thus, Cory the ex-Commander-in-Chief prevailed upon Noynoy to escort her to Fort Bonifacio. Thre, the combatants seethed with anger. Calmly, Cory wedged herself between protagonists, pulled out her story, and began to pray. Before long, the simmering confrontation was miraculously defused. Cory Aquino, who fearlessly staked her life to effect peaceful change serenely rested on the power of the Almighty, truly realizing her own powerlessness. 1) Why was Cory insistent on Noynoy's accompanying her to Fort Bonifacio Why was Noynoy opposed to his mother's plea for him to bring her to Fort Bonifacio? 2) What was Cory's reason for intervening in the fray? 3) What kind of "armament" did she use to put her conviction to action? 4) What character trait/s did she reveal in this incident?5) Is the title appropriate for the model paragraph? Explain your answer. 6) What is the setting? 7) Who are the characters? 8) Whose person is characterized? 9) What is the writer's point of view used?​</a>

People who spend hourupon hour reading don't get to live in the real world. They don't really learnanything that is useful about how to deal with everyday people andproblems. Plus, teachers always make read things that are boring.Paragraph BParents always talk about how If schools have school uniforms,everything would be so much easier. You wouldn't caught up on looks andwould learn the skills you need. I disagree with this, I think that schooluniforms would put a restriction on our creativity. We dress the way we do forcertain reason. Clothes give us expressions and ability to use colors andpatterns. The first impression we get of people is usually clothes, facialexpressions and language. If we all wear the same thing we don't get toreally see what people are like on the inside. Usually girly girls wear pink andfilly things. Skaters wear baggy pants and Goths usually wear blacks. Clothesdon't distracts us from learning the studies we need to, it simply let us inspireour imagination and lights up our words.​</a>

Write your answer in the diagram. Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy. There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growih. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher. The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul. It won't be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away. First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility - we need both. So we're making a serious mistake if a budget doesn't focus on what you're focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we're going to free up resources for the things that help us grow - education, infrastructure, research - we should cut what we don't need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don't help create jobs.This shouldn't be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking - not growing.Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There's already a broad coalition acrossAmerica that's behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow oureconomy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now theHouse should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by theend of this year. Third, we should pass a farm bill - one that America's farmers and ranchers can depend on, onethat protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities togrow and the longer-term certainty they deserve. We won't suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud ofcrisis has passed. But we shouldn't hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don't think it's goodpolitics, or just because the extremes in our parties don't like compromise. Ill look for willing partners from eitherparty to get important work done. There's no good reason why we can't govern responsibly, without lurching frommanufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn't governing - it's just hurting the people we were senthere to serve. Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best wecan. We come from different parties, but we're Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us,Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.Thanks everybody and have a great weekend.Point or claim:1.2.3.Evidence:1.2.3.Type of Evidence:1.2.3.​</a>

                            6. NO NONSENSE ANSWERS PLEASE! SPEECH PATTERNS PREP=Point, Reason, Example, Point● Use the PREP pattern to make a point. You can either agree or disagree with the topic or opinion. By wrapping up with a restatement of your point, you ensure that your speech is tightly structured.2. PPF= Past, Present, Future● Use the PPF when you want to share an opinion or situation that changes over time. Sharing anecdotes in this form will help your audience follow your story (and speech) easily.3.SMC= Story, Message, Call to action. ● When you want to sell an idea or convince your audience to take action, use this pattern. Close your speech with force, and you will have the world in the palm of your hands.Structure your speech- Your speech is composed mainly of the 3 essential elements: Introduction-Body and Conclusion.A. Introduction- this part is the attention getter/grabber, highly engaging and motivational. Your aim is to tell your audience who you are and what you’re talking about. In order to grab their attention, your greeting must be creative and make a great opening statement. Make it catchy, appealing, or captivating. It is also the part where the thesis statement is found. You may use any of the following techniques:● A rhetorical question- A question requiring no answer; however, it makes the audience think. This way, your audience are being hooked. Example: “I’m here to talk to you about what ordinary people can do to fight against climate change. Why? Because we’re running out of time to act.”● A surprising statement- Surprise is a powerful tool in any speech. It makes your audience sit up and pay attention.● A famous quote- line/s said by credible/well-known persons. Example: Former VP Binay once said, “Education is the great equalizer.”B. Body - it is where you present your arguments with several main points that include objection handling. Divide this main body into 2-3 points and separate each point into different paragraphs. C. Conclusion-A good conclusion takes everything you said and sums it up. Something that is memorable and calls your audience into action.​</h2><br />

                            9. POWER IN POWERLESSNESS The late former President Cory Aquino and her son Noynoy, at their Times Street residence in February 2006, heatedly debated her resolve to intercede during the Marine standoff at the then Fort Bonifacio. Noynoy, on whose lap fell the responsibility of looking after his mother after his father Ninoy was assassinated, was determined to keep her out of the fray, especially then when she was no longer president. Cory, however, remained obstinate as she unequivocally expressed her determination to proceed to Fort Bonifactio. Noynoy vehemently tried to dissuade her, citing grave danger and the volatility of the situation there. Furthermore, he wamed that those inside Fort Bonifacio were not exactly friendly forces and those outside were no less hostile than those besieged. But Cory stuck to her guns and declared, "Everything is simple. My duty is to avert bloodshed at all cost. Help me." Thus, Cory the ex-Commander-in-Chief prevailed upon Noynoy to escort her to Fort Bonifacio. Thre, the combatants seethed with anger. Calmly, Cory wedged herself between protagonists, pulled out her story, and began to pray. Before long, the simmering confrontation was miraculously defused. Cory Aquino, who fearlessly staked her life to effect peaceful change serenely rested on the power of the Almighty, truly realizing her own powerlessness. 1) Why was Cory insistent on Noynoy's accompanying her to Fort Bonifacio Why was Noynoy opposed to his mother's plea for him to bring her to Fort Bonifacio? 2) What was Cory's reason for intervening in the fray? 3) What kind of "armament" did she use to put her conviction to action? 4) What character trait/s did she reveal in this incident?5) Is the title appropriate for the model paragraph? Explain your answer. 6) What is the setting? 7) Who are the characters? 8) Whose person is characterized? 9) What is the writer's point of view used?​</h2><br />

Write your answer in the diagram. Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy. There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growih. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher. The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul. It won't be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away. First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility - we need both. So we're making a serious mistake if a budget doesn't focus on what you're focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we're going to free up resources for the things that help us grow - education, infrastructure, research - we should cut what we don't need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don't help create jobs.This shouldn't be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking - not growing.Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There's already a broad coalition acrossAmerica that's behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow oureconomy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now theHouse should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by theend of this year. Third, we should pass a farm bill - one that America's farmers and ranchers can depend on, onethat protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities togrow and the longer-term certainty they deserve. We won't suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud ofcrisis has passed. But we shouldn't hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don't think it's goodpolitics, or just because the extremes in our parties don't like compromise. Ill look for willing partners from eitherparty to get important work done. There's no good reason why we can't govern responsibly, without lurching frommanufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn't governing - it's just hurting the people we were senthere to serve. Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best wecan. We come from different parties, but we're Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us,Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.Thanks everybody and have a great weekend.Point or claim:1.2.3.Evidence:1.2.3.Type of Evidence:1.2.3.​</h2><br />
