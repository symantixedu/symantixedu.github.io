A truly loving Christian Community needs people to be together for better or for worse 4. Bearing wrong patiently further includes wishing for the transformation of our wrongdoers 5.

Revenge is indeed dangerous although it appears sweet to those who were wronged 7. St Paul tells us "Because you are God's chosen ones, holy and beloved clothe yourself with heartfelt mercy, kindness and patience. 8 Forgive one another as the Lord has forgiven you (Col 3:12) 9. Prayer is a sign of humility and acknowledgement that God rules our lives. 10. Present your needs to God in every form of prayer and petition full of gratitude 11. Patience means waiting for the right time when to fight for justice. 12. Love is the ultimate indicator of the fulfilment of God's Kingdom 13. We care for people, it means we love them​</a>

                                            •It all starts in a city / village north of Italy (15th/16th century). And in the village, is a small isolated castle, and in the castle, was an ugly guy. No one knows anything about the guy. This guy was so ugly, that he had to hide in the shadows. He came from a powerful family, but he shunned away. He eventually fell in love with the gardener's daughter. The only thing that gave him joy, was gardening. But one day, a girl came to the man's garden / hiding place, and stole flowers. The guy was furious and spied over his flowers at night. Then, she came back and stole some more flowers.It kept on happening for a few days, until the man got curious and night, he pretended to sleep. He saw the girl again, but this time, when the girl left, he covered himself with a blanket and followed.

Phase Out the Obsolete Jeepney  (an excerpt)  
By: Neal H. Cruz
If the jeepney strike pushes through today, the government should use it to phase out the jeepneys. This World War II relic should have been phased out a long time ago but successive administrations had no balls to go through with the phase out. They were afraid of the jeepney drivers who always threatened a strike when they were told to obey the law. And there were not enough buses to replace the jeepneys to service commuters.
But the jeepney, although a tourist attraction and a romantic example of folk art, is the principal source of the daily traffic jams. Its drivers are undisciplined, reckless and probably don’t know half of the traffic rules. Because of the huge number of vehicles in Metro Manila, there is only one way to improve traffic: make each and every driver, private and public, obey each and every traffic rule.
Jeepney drivers have gotten away for so long with murder by bribing corrupt policemen that it is a shock to them to be made to obey traffic rules and be fined if they violate them. Anarchy reigns in the streets because of them.
Although they are not in the driver’s seat, jeepney operators are also to blame for the anarchy. They make the drivers pay a flat rental (the boundary) for the jeepney. Whatever the driver earns in excess of the boundary, plus the cost of fuel and oil-and bribes- is his take home pay. So the driver is forced to break traffic rules so that he can earn as much as he can. But that is no excuse.
Perhaps if the operator pays his driver a regular salary, plus social security and mediocre premiums, and fixed times for trips, the driver would be less reckless and we would have more orderly traffic.
As for the jeepney terminals, they really are a source of traffic congestion. Try this: whenever you come to a traffic jam, trace the source and in may cases it would be a jeepney terminal. Jeepneys lined up along narrow street take up space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminal- and bigger fares for passengers.
Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in passengers of ten jeepneys but take up only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepney is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was a great as emergency civilian transportation during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city.
The phase out doesn’t mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there.
Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules so they don’t have to clog loading//unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and buses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn’t have to wait long for passsengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience.
Encourage commuters to use the Metrotren by improving the coaches and having more trips.
Use the Pasig River. The Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats are small. Hongkong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road. (There used to be one; why was it discontinued?)
And hurry up with the C-5 and the C-6…</a>

When the children tried to shoo them away, waving theirarms and crying, it did not seem to disturb the birds at all.6 "When we came early in the morning, they were already here, and we tried to shoo them away.really we did, and they hopped around a bit, but they would not fly away, and then they began tosing and then we began to dance, we just had too and now we are dancing and they are singingand you must join us!, said the children."7 Annoyed and worried, the wife scolded the children for letting the birds fool them like that.

                                            1. Before clocks were made, people kept track of time by other means. In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock. Water dripped slowly from one clay pot into another. People measured time according to how long it took one pot to empty and the other one to fill. Candle clocks were common during the Middle Ages. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about how much time had passed. A final ancient way to measure time was the sundial, which used the movement of the sun across the sky. The shadows moving across the face of the sundial showed the current time.What is the main idea? a. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about how much time had passed b. Before clocks were made, people kept track by other means. c. In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock. d. All the above. 2. (1) One common example of instinct is the spider's spinning of its intricate web. (2) No one teaches a spider how to spin: its inborn instinct allows it to accomplish the task. (3) Another example of instinctive behavior is the salmon's struggle to swim upstream to lay eggs.

                                            Read and answer the following questions in sentence form. (2 points each) ABRAHAM’S COVENANT There was once a faithful man of God who worked hard and was blessed by God. Sadly, the one thing he did not have was a child. He longed for a son, and when the Lord promised to make him the father of many nations, Abram was happy and waited for his promised child. However, years went by and his wife Sarai still did not give him a son. In an attempt to take things into her own hands, Sarai convinced Abram to marry her maidservant Hagar, who was from Egypt. Abram did so, and Hagar became pregnant with a son. When the child was born, he was called Ishmael. This was not the child of promise, for the Lord promised that a son would be born to Sarai, and that He would bless Abram through him. One day, three men visited Abram, who showed them great hospitality. These men were actually God and His angels who came in disguise. They told Abram that by the same time next year, Sarai would have a son. Sarai laughed, as she thought she was much too old to have a child. The Lord also gave Abram and Sarai new names, and from then they were known as Abraham and Sarah, for Sarah means “Princess”, and she would be the mother of many nations. What would you do if you were in Abram’s position?​</a>

No one knows anything about the guy. This guy was so ugly, that he had to hide in the shadows. He came from a powerful family, but he shunned away. He eventually fell in love with the gardener's daughter. The only thing that gave him joy, was gardening. But one day, a girl came to the man's garden / hiding place, and stole flowers. The guy was furious and spied over his flowers at night. Then, she came back and stole some more flowers.It kept on happening for a few days, until the man got curious and night, he pretended to sleep. He saw the girl again, but this time, when the girl left, he covered himself with a blanket and followed. By following her, he found out that she was poor and ill and the only way for her to survive was to sell the stolen flowers.Seeing here like this, he wanted to help her out in every way. But he was too afraid that she would be scared of him. He could only keep on growing flowers. He suddenly has the idea to create a non-existent flower, that she could sell at a more expensive price. After several tries, he finally created the perfect flower. He was excited, he planted them and grew many of them. He waited for the girl, but she didn't come. No matter how long he waited, she didn't come. Then he went looking for her, but he realized what happened.He was too late.

If You were exposed like  frontliners from their patients that is positive or when you are experiencing the symptoms, you have to do the 14 days quarantine rule or if possible go to the hospital if you cant handle it anymore. We also need to support each other and help others that are in need. We have to work together to fight the pandemic that was happening.

Phase Out the Obsolete Jeepney  (an excerpt)  
By: Neal H. Cruz
If the jeepney strike pushes through today, the government should use it to phase out the jeepneys. This World War II relic should have been phased out a long time ago but successive administrations had no balls to go through with the phase out. They were afraid of the jeepney drivers who always threatened a strike when they were told to obey the law. And there were not enough buses to replace the jeepneys to service commuters.
But the jeepney, although a tourist attraction and a romantic example of folk art, is the principal source of the daily traffic jams. Its drivers are undisciplined, reckless and probably don’t know half of the traffic rules. Because of the huge number of vehicles in Metro Manila, there is only one way to improve traffic: make each and every driver, private and public, obey each and every traffic rule.
Jeepney drivers have gotten away for so long with murder by bribing corrupt policemen that it is a shock to them to be made to obey traffic rules and be fined if they violate them. Anarchy reigns in the streets because of them.
Although they are not in the driver’s seat, jeepney operators are also to blame for the anarchy. They make the drivers pay a flat rental (the boundary) for the jeepney. Whatever the driver earns in excess of the boundary, plus the cost of fuel and oil-and bribes- is his take home pay. So the driver is forced to break traffic rules so that he can earn as much as he can. But that is no excuse.
Perhaps if the operator pays his driver a regular salary, plus social security and mediocre premiums, and fixed times for trips, the driver would be less reckless and we would have more orderly traffic.
As for the jeepney terminals, they really are a source of traffic congestion. Try this: whenever you come to a traffic jam, trace the source and in may cases it would be a jeepney terminal. Jeepneys lined up along narrow street take up space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminal- and bigger fares for passengers.
Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in passengers of ten jeepneys but take up only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepney is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was a great as emergency civilian transportation during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city.
The phase out doesn’t mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there.
Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules so they don’t have to clog loading//unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and buses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn’t have to wait long for passsengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience.
Encourage commuters to use the Metrotren by improving the coaches and having more trips.
Use the Pasig River. The Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats are small. Hongkong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road. (There used to be one; why was it discontinued?)

People measured time according to how long it took one pot to empty and the other one to fill. Candle clocks were common during the Middle Ages. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about how much time had passed. A final ancient way to measure time was the sundial, which used the movement of the sun across the sky.

                            30. Read and answer the following questions in sentence form. (2 points each) ABRAHAM’S COVENANT There was once a faithful man of God who worked hard and was blessed by God. Sadly, the one thing he did not have was a child. He longed for a son, and when the Lord promised to make him the father of many nations, Abram was happy and waited for his promised child. However, years went by and his wife Sarai still did not give him a son. In an attempt to take things into her own hands, Sarai convinced Abram to marry her maidservant Hagar, who was from Egypt. Abram did so, and Hagar became pregnant with a son. When the child was born, he was called Ishmael. This was not the child of promise, for the Lord promised that a son would be born to Sarai, and that He would bless Abram through him. One day, three men visited Abram, who showed them great hospitality. These men were actually God and His angels who came in disguise. They told Abram that by the same time next year, Sarai would have a son. Sarai laughed, as she thought she was much too old to have a child. The Lord also gave Abram and Sarai new names, and from then they were known as Abraham and Sarah, for Sarah means “Princess”, and she would be the mother of many nations. What would you do if you were in Abram’s position?​</h2><br />
                        "What would you do if you were in Abram's position?"<p><strong>If I were in Abram's position, I would continue to have faith in God's promises and trust that He would fulfill them in His own time. I would not take matters into my own hands or try to make things happen through my own efforts, instead, I would wait patiently and continue to serve and obey God.</strong></p><br />
