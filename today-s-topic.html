                                            Learning Opportunity 9 Directions: Read the paragraph and answer the questions below. Despite historic progress on developing new tools to fight COVID-19 including nine vaccines listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use -- inequitable access means the pandemic is actually worse today than it was a year ago. Last December, I wrote about COVID-19's confirmed global death toll of 1.5 million. Just one year later, that number stands in excess of 5 million. So far, the world has delivered 7 billion vaccines and counting, but they are being distributed unequally. According to Our World in Data, more than eight times as many boosters are administered globally every day than are primary doses in low income countries. It is a global injustice, and the most vulnerable people remain the most at risk. Only 1 in 4 health care workers in Africa have been fully vaccinated despite serving on the pandemic's front lines, for example, according to WHO. QUESTIONS 1. What is the main topic of the text? 2. What is the tone of the text? 3. Is the writer positive about covid-19 vaccines? What line proves your answer? 4.What reasons did the author include to present the intended meaning of the text?pa answer po pwede​</a>

                                            I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The issue of the alleged indolence of the Filipino people during the Spanish colonization has been a longstanding debate. One of the notable personalities who discussed this topic is Jose Rizal. In his essay "The Indolence of the Filipino," he presented his views on the causes and solutions to the Filipino's perceived lack of work ethic.</p><p></p><p>Analysis:</p><p>Rizal wrote his essay during the late 19th century, a time when the Philippines was enduring colonization by the Spaniards. In his writing, he attempted to debunk the stereotype that Filipinos are lazy and unproductive. Rizal argued that the Filipino people's seeming indolence was due to several reasons.</p><p></p><p>First, he pointed out that the rampant corruption within the government has demoralized the people. They see that officials abuse their power and enrich themselves and their families at the expense of the masses.</p><p></p><p>Second, he emphasized that the lack of educational opportunities prevented Filipinos from advancing their skills, knowledge, and capabilities. As a result, they failed to develop a sense of pride and dignity in their work.</p><p></p><p>Third, Rizal highlighted the negative impact of the tropical climate on the people's health and productivity. The heat and humidity, coupled with poor sanitation practices, made it difficult for them to work for extended periods.</p><p></p><p>To solve the issue of Filipino indolence, Rizal suggested several solutions. Firstly, he advocated for the government to reduce corruption by promoting social justice and imposing strict laws against graft and corruption. Secondly, he urged the authorities to provide more educational opportunities to the people to enhance their knowledge and skills. Lastly, Rizal recommended that people should embrace the value of hard work and discipline to overcome the adverse effects of the climate.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The indolence of the Filipino is not a deeply ingrained trait but rather a product of the environment and the prevailing social and economic structures. It is crucial to address the underlying causes to help Filipinos change their attitudes towards work.</p><p></p><p>Recommendation:</p><p>It is incumbent upon the government and the people to work together to improve the situation. Officials should be held accountable for their actions, and educational opportunities should be made available to all. Additionally, Filipinos must embrace a work ethic that values hard work and discipline, even in challenging circumstances.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana po maka tulong pa brainliest narin po </p><br />

                            16. Learning Opportunity 9 Directions: Read the paragraph and answer the questions below. Despite historic progress on developing new tools to fight COVID-19 including nine vaccines listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use -- inequitable access means the pandemic is actually worse today than it was a year ago. Last December, I wrote about COVID-19's confirmed global death toll of 1.5 million. Just one year later, that number stands in excess of 5 million. So far, the world has delivered 7 billion vaccines and counting, but they are being distributed unequally. According to Our World in Data, more than eight times as many boosters are administered globally every day than are primary doses in low income countries. It is a global injustice, and the most vulnerable people remain the most at risk. Only 1 in 4 health care workers in Africa have been fully vaccinated despite serving on the pandemic's front lines, for example, according to WHO. QUESTIONS 1. What is the main topic of the text? 2. What is the tone of the text? 3. Is the writer positive about covid-19 vaccines? What line proves your answer? 4.What reasons did the author include to present the intended meaning of the text?pa answer po pwede​</h2><br />

                            24. I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.
