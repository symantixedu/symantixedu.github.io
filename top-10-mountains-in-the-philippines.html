                                            Instructions. Read each item carefully. Write T if the statement is true and F if it is false. Write your answer on the space provided before the number. 1. The earth's interior is comprised of four distinct layers. 2. The solid layer where we walk, run and build our houses is called the crust. 3. The mantle is located below the crust, at around 2,890 km thick. It is considered as the thickest layer of the earth. 4. The outer core is different from the rest of the earth's layer as it is the only layer in liquid form. 5. The inner core is the densest layer of the earth and is composed of solid iron with traces of nickel. 6. Waves that pass through the earth's interior are called body waves 7. Scientists specialized in the study of earthquakes are called seismologists. 8. S-waves or secondary waves move faster than P-waves. 9. P-waves or primary waves move slower than S-waves. 10. P-waves are considered as longitudinal waves and are the first seismic waves being recorded on a seismogram. 11. Philippines is not prone to typhoon. 12. Typhoons are destructive and not easy to deal with. 13. Typhoons usually form/develop in the warm tropical oceans. 14. The eye of the typhoon is the most destructive part. 15. Rain bands surround the eyewall. 16. A typhoon is characterized by heavy rain, high winds and low atmospheric pressure. 17. The cold air on mountain top prevents the formation of a typhoon. 18. When typhoon landfalls on landforms, it will weaken. 19. Landforms and bodies of water affect the formation of a typhoon. 20. Typhoon is stronger when in landforms.​</a>
