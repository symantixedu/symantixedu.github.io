                                            Polarity in Everyday Life: How Soap Works? During the COVID-19 (new coronavirus disease) pandemic, countries all of the world must take decisive action to stop the spread of the virus. In these er circumstances, it is essential that everyone is informed about health naksfor hazards to stay safe and healthy. One of the recommendations of the world heah organization is washing hand using soap. Soap does not kill germs on our hands, it removes them. Microbes stick to the oils and grease on our hands. Water alone will not remove much of the germs of our hands because water and oil do not like each other, so they will not mix But soap likes both water and oil. That is because soap molecules are a type of surfactant. which means they have one end that's water loving, or hydrophilic, and one end that's oil loving, or hydrophobic. When you wash your hands with soap, the soap molecules act as a mediator between the water and oil molecules and bind with both at the same time. Then when you rinse everything off the soap carries away the germs with the water. contem Questions: 1. Does soap remove germs and viruses? Explain why.2. Why is it important to frequently wash our hands with soap and water? 16 1​</a>

                            15. Polarity in Everyday Life: How Soap Works? During the COVID-19 (new coronavirus disease) pandemic, countries all of the world must take decisive action to stop the spread of the virus. In these er circumstances, it is essential that everyone is informed about health naksfor hazards to stay safe and healthy. One of the recommendations of the world heah organization is washing hand using soap. Soap does not kill germs on our hands, it removes them. Microbes stick to the oils and grease on our hands. Water alone will not remove much of the germs of our hands because water and oil do not like each other, so they will not mix But soap likes both water and oil. That is because soap molecules are a type of surfactant. which means they have one end that's water loving, or hydrophilic, and one end that's oil loving, or hydrophobic. When you wash your hands with soap, the soap molecules act as a mediator between the water and oil molecules and bind with both at the same time. Then when you rinse everything off the soap carries away the germs with the water. contem Questions: 1. Does soap remove germs and viruses? Explain why.2. Why is it important to frequently wash our hands with soap and water? 16 1​</h2><br />
