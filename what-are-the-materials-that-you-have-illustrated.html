Do you have the following accessories? Which of these do you like? Can you identify the materials used in making these accessories and crafts? Write your answer on the box.
1. From what materials do you think these crafts are made up of?
2. What clues gave you an idea about the materials that might have been used
in making each craft?
3. In what occasions or places can those crafts be mostly observed?
The previous activity guided you to look closely in the designs for you to figure
out the materials used. In the next parts of the module, try to discover how these materials have something to do with the culture of the place and how it can be localized to modify its distinct characteristics.

</p><p>
2. Metals are an excellent conductor of electricity and heat because the atoms in the metals form a matrix through which outer electrons can move freely. Instead of orbiting their respective atoms, they form a sea of electrons that surround the positive nuclei of the interacting metal ions.
</p><p>
3. Usually good current carrying conductors should have following properties: Low resistivity/ / high conductivity. Low temperature coefficient of resistivity. Good thermal conductivity.
</p><p>
4. The conductor and insulator are the types of material. One of the major difference between the conductor and insulator is that the conductor allows the energy (i.e., current or heat ) to pass through it, whereas the insulator does not allow the energy to pass through it.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. it can be  posters, flyers, magazines, and books and art</p><p>2. Metals are particularly good conductors of heat because their particles are very closely packed so the vibrations are passed on very quickly. They also contain large numbers of free electrons. ... This makes them move faster and they travel through the metal, colliding with both atoms and other electrons.</p><p>3. Usually good current carrying conductors should have following properties: Low resistivity/ / high conductivity. Low temperature coefficient of resistivity. Good thermal conductivity.</p><p>4.In a conductor, electric current can flow freely, in an insulator it cannot. Metals such as copper typify conductors, while most non-metallic solids are said to be good insulators, having extremely high resistance to the flow of charge through them. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Does the properties of these materials has something to do with it?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Properties of Metals</p><p>An element is a substance made up of one kind of atom; it cannot be separated into simpler parts. For example, the element helium (think hot-air balloons) is made up exclusively of helium atoms.</p><p></p><p>Elements are generally classified as metals or nonmetals (although some elements have characteristics of both; these are called metalloids).</p><p></p><p>Three properties of metals are:</p><p></p><p>Luster: Metals are shiny when cut, scratched, or polished.</p><p>Malleability: Metals are strong but malleable, which means that they can be easily bent or shaped. For centuries, smiths have been able to shape metal objects by heating metal and pounding it with a hammer. If they tried this with nonmetals, the material would shatter! Most metals are also ductile, which means they can be drawn out to make wire.</p><p>Conductivity: Metals are excellent conductors of electricity and heat. Because they are also ductile, they are ideal for electrical wiring. (You can test this using some household items.</p><p></p><p>2. A physical property is a characteristic of matter that is not associated with a change in its chemical composition. Familiar examples of physical properties include density, color, hardness, melting and boiling points, and electrical conductivity. We can observe some physical properties, such as density and color, without changing the physical state of the matter observed. Other physical properties, such as the melting temperature of iron or the freezing temperature of water, can only be observed as matter undergoes a physical change.</p><p></p><br />

                            23.  What’s New
Do you have the following accessories? Which of these do you like? Can you identify the materials used in making these accessories and crafts? Write your answer on the box.
1. From what materials do you think these crafts are made up of?
2. What clues gave you an idea about the materials that might have been used
in making each craft?
3. In what occasions or places can those crafts be mostly observed?
The previous activity guided you to look closely in the designs for you to figure
out the materials used. In the next parts of the module, try to discover how these materials have something to do with the culture of the place and how it can be localized to modify its distinct characteristics.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1..When you mix the rubbing alcohol with water, the latter's molecules make hydrogen bonds with the water molecules. The alcohol dissolves in the water to form a homogenous solution, so you cannot distinguish the alcohol and the water anymore.</p><p></p><p>2..When you mix the rubbing alcohol with water, the latter's molecules make hydrogen bonds with the water molecules. The alcohol dissolves in the water to form a homogenous solution, so you cannot distinguish the alcohol and the water anymore.</p><p></p><p>3..This is due to the miscibility of the different liquids. If liquids have a very different chemical structure that makes one polar and the other one unpolar, they will not mix and always stay separate.</p><p></p><p>4..Homogeneous Liquid-Liquid Mixture:</p><p></p><p> This is a type of liquid-liquid mixture whereby the two substances mix completely to from a single substance. Examples are: Alcoholic drinks (alcohol mixed with flavorings). Juice (water mixed with flavorings).</p><p></p><p>5..As a result, when you add oil to a cup of water the two don't mix with each other. Because oil is less dense than water, it will always float on top of water, creating a surface layer of oil. You might have seen this on streets after a heavy rain—some water puddles will have a coating of oil floating on them.</p><p></p><p>6..⌫</p><br />
