Title: "How does sound travel in different materials?"Materials:Stick of at least one foot longSmall pail (bucket) half filled with waterTwo pieces of medium sized stoneA table or a chair preferably made of wood or metalDrum and drumsticks (toys will do)Big Tin can if drum is not availableProcedures:1. Find a table or a chair. With the use of a stick, gently tap the table or the chair. What did you hear? Do this for at least five times with different strengths of tapping. Try from gentle to hart tap. Observe the sound you produced with each tap.2. Tap to medium-sized stone in a pail half filled with water. Be careful not to spill the water when you tap the stones. Observe what happens when the stones hit each other. Do you hear a sound? Do this for at least five times.3. Do this third task in an open area with a partner (other member of your family). Let your partner stay at least 10 meters away from you. Strike a drum with drumsticks. Can both of you hear the sound the drum made? Strike the drum with different strength, Try it from a gentle tap to a hard tap. Take note of the sound that is produced.Questions:1. Did you hear a sound when you tapped the table or the chair with a stick? What happened to the sound when you tapped the table with different strengths?2. Were you able to produce sound underwater when you struck/hit two stones together?3. Were you able to hear the sound you produced underwater?4. Did the sound coming from the drum reach the person away from it?5. What could you infer from this activity?Learning task 4: Prepare the materials listed below.

Scoop margarine from its container then spread it to the half-end, close the head of the nail.3. With the use of a pair of tongs, hold the part of he nail where you spread the margarine.4. Slowly bring the part of the nail without margarine to the tip of the flame of the alcohol lamp or candle. Hold the nail in the flame until you observe a change in the margarine.5. Record your observations.Questions:1. What happened to the margarine on the nail?2. Why do you think the change took place even if it was not directly exposed to the flame?3. If we are using a metal tong and continue to expose the nail to the flame, what do you think will happen to the metal tong?4. If we are using a pair of metal tongs and continue to expose the nail to the flame, what do you think will happen to the metal tongs?SET BProcedures:1. Fill a mug with hot water. Be extra careful when pouring hot water to the mug. (Ask assistance of an adult.)2. Place a metal spoon into the coffee mug.3. Wait for about five minutes. Carefully feel the exposed end of the spoon. Slightly touch the outside surface of the mug, too. Record your observation.Questions:1. What happened o the exposed end of the spoon after five minutes?2. What did you notice about the outside surface of the mug when you touched it? Why?3. Suggest ways to reduce the effect of heat on the turner so that we can avoid getting hurt when we lit it out of the hot pan.Not to do:Nonsense = Report every nonsense answer in your profileGuessing the answer = Report every nonsense answer in your profileWrong answer = Report every nonsense answer in your profileTo Do:Perfect answer = Brainliest mark, 5 Stars, Thank you heart, 20 years of luck.Almost perfect answer = 5 Stars, Thank you heart. 12 years of luck.</a>

The Sampaguita is known for its fragrance and the role it plays in the legends andtraditions of the Filipino people. This shrub was introduced into our country fromIndia. It is short-stemmed, and has glossy, hardy leaves six to twelve centimeterslong. The flowers are small, fragrant, pure white and glossy. They look like smallroses from a distance. This plant bears plenty of flowers in April, May, and June.12 Malunggay is horseradish. Did you know that poultice of malunggay leaves canbe used to decrease the swelling of sores and boils? A poultice is a soft compo-sition, such as with leaves, which can be applied over the swollen area of the skin.Malunggay is also used as a laxative. Laxative is a medicine taken to loosen thebowels.13. Climate is the overall state of weather in a place over a long period of time.Climate have changed over time in Earth's history. Climate change may be dueto changes in the amount of energy from the sun or the amount of dust in theatmosphere. In recent years, scientists have discovered that temperatures aregradually rising around the world. The trend is known as global warming. It isimportant to learn more about how climate changes because it affects theenvironment and way of life.14. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in someaspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the class-rooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should takeplace. On the other hand, the classrooms today utilize technology like LCDprojectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lessons in the past werefrom print materials while lessons of today are from e-books and other onlineplatforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today arewhat matters most is how effective learning takes place.15 Spiders are small animals. Although they look like insects, they are not. Insects havesix legs; spiders have eight. Insects have feelers and wings, spiders do not havethese. Insect bodies have three parts, spider have two.16. There is no other Filipino like Jose Protacio Rizal. He was the greatest Filipino of thenineteenth century and possibly of the past and future generations as well. Hewas a shining example of the height and glory to which a Filipino could possiblyrise. Rizal was born in Calamba, Laguna, on June 19.1861. He came from a verywell-known and respected family of traders and farm owners.​</a>

Feel it. Is it straight or bent? Guide Questions: a. Describe the appearance of the plastic straw when you viewed it from the top. b. Describe the appearance of the plastic straw when you viewed it from the side. c. Did the appearance of the plastic straw change when you took it out of the glass d. What do your observations show about the way light travels through different media? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>a. When viewed from the top, the plastic straw appears to be straight and uninterrupted.</p><p></p><p>b. When viewed from the side, the plastic straw appears to be bent or distorted.</p><p></p><p>c. Yes, the appearance of the plastic straw changed when taken out of the glass. It appears straight again.</p><p></p><p>d. The observations show that light travels differently through air and water. When the straw is in water, the light passing through it bends due to the change in medium. This phenomenon is known as refraction. When the straw is taken out of the water and back into the air, the light travels straight through it again.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            30. B. Read the selections and identity each structure. Identity whether DESCRIPTION, COMPAREand CONTRAST, PROBLEM and SOLUTION, SEQUENCE and CAUSE and EFFECT.11. The Sampaguita is known for its fragrance and the role it plays in the legends andtraditions of the Filipino people. This shrub was introduced into our country fromIndia. It is short-stemmed, and has glossy, hardy leaves six to twelve centimeterslong. The flowers are small, fragrant, pure white and glossy. They look like smallroses from a distance. This plant bears plenty of flowers in April, May, and June.12 Malunggay is horseradish. Did you know that poultice of malunggay leaves canbe used to decrease the swelling of sores and boils? A poultice is a soft compo-sition, such as with leaves, which can be applied over the swollen area of the skin.Malunggay is also used as a laxative. Laxative is a medicine taken to loosen thebowels.13. Climate is the overall state of weather in a place over a long period of time.Climate have changed over time in Earth's history. Climate change may be dueto changes in the amount of energy from the sun or the amount of dust in theatmosphere. In recent years, scientists have discovered that temperatures aregradually rising around the world. The trend is known as global warming. It isimportant to learn more about how climate changes because it affects theenvironment and way of life.14. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in someaspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the class-rooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should takeplace. On the other hand, the classrooms today utilize technology like LCDprojectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lessons in the past werefrom print materials while lessons of today are from e-books and other onlineplatforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today arewhat matters most is how effective learning takes place.15 Spiders are small animals. Although they look like insects, they are not. Insects havesix legs; spiders have eight. Insects have feelers and wings, spiders do not havethese. Insect bodies have three parts, spider have two.16. There is no other Filipino like Jose Protacio Rizal. He was the greatest Filipino of thenineteenth century and possibly of the past and future generations as well. Hewas a shining example of the height and glory to which a Filipino could possiblyrise. Rizal was born in Calamba, Laguna, on June 19.1861. He came from a verywell-known and respected family of traders and farm owners.​</h2><br />
