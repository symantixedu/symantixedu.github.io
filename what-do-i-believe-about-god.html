Gospel, John 6:60-69
60 After hearing it, many of his followers said, 'This is intolerable language. How could anyone accept it?'
61 Jesus was aware that his followers were complaining about it and said, 'Does this disturb you?
62 What if you should see the Son of man ascend to where he was before?
63 'It is the spirit that gives life, the flesh has nothing to offer. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.
64 'But there are some of you who do not believe.' For Jesus knew from the outset who did not believe and who was to betray him.
65 He went on, 'This is why I told you that no one could come to me except by the gift of the Father.'
66 After this, many of his disciples went away and accompanied him no more.
67 Then Jesus said to the Twelve, 'What about you, do you want to go away too?'
68 Simon Peter answered, 'Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the message of eternal life,
69 and we believe; we have come to know that you are the Holy One of God.'</a>

You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached— how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.
“We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross, but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.” Acts 10: 34a, 37-43

Jesus came, although the doors were locked, and stood in their midst and said, "Peace be with you." 27Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here and see my hands, and bring your hand and put it into my side, and do not be unbelieving, but believe." 28Thomas answered and said to him, "My Lord and my God!" 29Jesus said to him, "Have you come to believe because you have seen me?

He finds himself in the Purgatory waiting room, when God enters…“Well, Bill,” says God, “I’m confused. I’m not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell: you helped society enormously by putting a computer in almost every home in the world, and yet you’ve also created some of the most unearthly frustrations known to mankind. I’m going to do something I’ve never done before: I’m going to let you choose where you want to go.”Bill replies, “Well, thanks, God. What’s the difference between the two?”God says, “I’m willing to let you visit both places briefly to help you make your decision.”“Okay, where should I go first?” asks Bill.God says, “That’s up to you.”Bill says, “OK, let’s try Hell first.”So Bill goes to Hell. It’s a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters. There are thousands of beautiful women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about. The sun is shining, the temperature is just right. The whole thing looks perfect, and Bill is very pleased.“This is great!” he tells God, “If this is Hell, I REALLY want to see Heaven!”“Fine,” says God, and off they go.Heaven is a high place in the clouds, with angels drifting about playing harps and singing. It very nice but not as enticing as Hell. Bill thinks for a moment and announces his decision.“Hmm, I think I prefer Hell.” he tells God.“Fine,” says God, “As you desire.”So Bill Gates is taken to Hell.Two weeks later, God decides to check up on Bill to see how he’s doing in Hell. When God arrives in Hell, he finds Bill shackled to a wall, screaming amongst the hot flames in a dark cave. He’s being burned and tortured by demons.“How’s everything going, Bill?” God asks.Bill replies, his voice full of anguish and disappointment, “This is awful, it’s not what I expected at all, I can’t believe it. What happened to that other place with the beaches and the beautiful women playing in the water?”God smiles and says, “That was the screen saver.”​</a>

Is this only for their nation or for all those who wish to follow their leadership? What about the countries where people are still starving and fighting today?</p><p>- Message I get from the speech is <strong>in this speech, Churchill aimed to counter the jubilant public reaction</strong> provoked by the evacuation from Dunkirk and bring the discussion back to reality. But, as Churchill famously cautions in the speech, "We must be very careful not to attach the characteristics of a victory to this deliverance."</p><p>Winston Churchill's unforgettable speeches reinforced Britain's resolve during the terrible times of World War Two. When he was 22 years old, he wrote, "Of all the gifts bestowed upon men, none is more valuable than the gift of oratory. </p><p>- The tone of the speech is <strong>quite solemn, grave, and inspiring.</strong> Winston Churchill was concerned about the welfare of the United Kingdom since he was aware that they could fight or surrender.

64 'But there are some of you who do not believe.' For Jesus knew from the outset who did not believe and who was to betray him.
65 He went on, 'This is why I told you that no one could come to me except by the gift of the Father.'
66 After this, many of his disciples went away and accompanied him no more.
67 Then Jesus said to the Twelve, 'What about you, do you want to go away too?'
68 Simon Peter answered, 'Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the message of eternal life,
69 and we believe; we have come to know that you are the Holy One of God.'</h2><br />

The gospel's message is no different from our situation today. We are in division and while some practice their faith, there are also those who don't.

                            25. Then Peter began to speak: “I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism. You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached— how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.
“We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross, but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.” Acts 10: 34a, 37-43

He finds himself in the Purgatory waiting room, when God enters…“Well, Bill,” says God, “I’m confused. I’m not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell: you helped society enormously by putting a computer in almost every home in the world, and yet you’ve also created some of the most unearthly frustrations known to mankind. I’m going to do something I’ve never done before: I’m going to let you choose where you want to go.”Bill replies, “Well, thanks, God. What’s the difference between the two?”God says, “I’m willing to let you visit both places briefly to help you make your decision.”“Okay, where should I go first?” asks Bill.God says, “That’s up to you.”Bill says, “OK, let’s try Hell first.”So Bill goes to Hell. It’s a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters. There are thousands of beautiful women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about. The sun is shining, the temperature is just right. The whole thing looks perfect, and Bill is very pleased.“This is great!” he tells God, “If this is Hell, I REALLY want to see Heaven!”“Fine,” says God, and off they go.Heaven is a high place in the clouds, with angels drifting about playing harps and singing. It very nice but not as enticing as Hell. Bill thinks for a moment and announces his decision.“Hmm, I think I prefer Hell.” he tells God.“Fine,” says God, “As you desire.”So Bill Gates is taken to Hell.Two weeks later, God decides to check up on Bill to see how he’s doing in Hell. When God arrives in Hell, he finds Bill shackled to a wall, screaming amongst the hot flames in a dark cave. He’s being burned and tortured by demons.“How’s everything going, Bill?” God asks.Bill replies, his voice full of anguish and disappointment, “This is awful, it’s not what I expected at all, I can’t believe it. What happened to that other place with the beaches and the beautiful women playing in the water?”God smiles and says, “That was the screen saver.”​</h2><br />
