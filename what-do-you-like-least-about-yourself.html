                                            In England once there lived a big
And wonderfully clever pig.
To everybody it was plain
That Piggy had a massive brain.
He worked out sums inside his head,
There was no book he hadn't read.
He knew what made an airplane fly,
He knew how engines worked and why.
He knew all this, but in the end
One question drove him round the bend:
He simply couldn't puzzle out
What LIFE was really all about.
What was the reason for his birth?
Why was he placed upon this earth?
His giant brain went round and round.
Alas, no answer could be found.
Till suddenly one wondrous night.
All in a flash he saw the light.
He jumped up like a ballet dancer
And yelled, 'By gum, I've got the answer! '
'They want my bacon slice by slice
'To sell at a tremendous price!
'They want my tender juicy chops
'To put in all the butcher's shops!
'They want my pork to make a roast
'And that's the part'll cost the most!
'They want my sausages in strings!
'They even want my chitterlings!
'The butcher's shop! The carving knife!
'That is the reason for my life! '
Such thoughts as these are not designed
To give a pig great peace of mind.
Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,
A pail of pigswill in his hand,
And piggy with a mighty roar,
Bashes the farmer to the floor…
Now comes the rather grisly bit
So let's not make too much of it,
Except that you must understand
That Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,
He ate him up from head to toe,
Chewing the pieces nice and slow.
It took an hour to reach the feet,
Because there was so much to eat,
And when he finished, Pig, of course,
Felt absolutely no remorse.
Slowly he scratched his brainy head
And with a little smile he said,
'I had a fairly powerful hunch
'That he might have me for his lunch.
'And so, because I feared the worst,
'I thought I'd better eat him first.'

But even Sara's mom cannot find cure for the coronavirus. “What does COVID-19 look like?- Sarah asked her mom. "COVID-19 or the Corona virus is very tiny, we can't see it," said her mom." But it spreads in the coughs and sneezes of people who are sick and when they touch people or things around them. People who are sick get a fever and cough and can have some trouble in breathing “So, we can't fight it because we can't see it, Sara asked, "We can fight it, Sara's mom answered. The virus affects many kinds of people and everyone can help fight it. Children are special and they can help too. You need to stay safe for all of us. I need you to be my hero." "Heroes have superpowers”. She said to herself closing her eyes to sleep. "I need a way to tell all children in the world how to protect everyone else, Sarah said. "I need something that can fly, something with a big voice and something that can help!" she added. Suddenly a shadow appeared in front of her. What are you? asked Sara "I'm Pedro, a flying Pegasus," it replied. "I never seen a Pegasus before. Sara whispered. “Maybe if I have you, I can tell all the children in the world about Coronavirus," said Sara. "Yes sure. Nothing can harm you when we're together," replied Pedro. Sara jumped on Pedro's back and together they soared out through her bedroom window, into the night sky. They flew towards the stars and said hello to the moon. They talked to different people around the world and told them the things they need to do to avoid spreading of coronavirus. “Wash your hands with soap and water. Instead of shaking hands, we wave to people. We try to stay inside especially for crowded city. People must stop travelling and should closed the boarders across the world. Stay at least one meter apart from each other. Isolate yourself if you are not feeling well. We should not stop taking care of one another. “Sara said. "We can do things for each other," Pedro added. Sarah fell asleep and when she woke up the next day, Pedro was gone. Sara ran to her mom with her drawing to tell her the news. “There are many heroes keeping people safe from the Corona virus, like wonderful doctors and nurses. But you remind me that we can all be heroes every day," Sara's mom said. 1. What is Sara's mom's profession? 2. What causes people to get sick? 3.

The best trip my family ever took was to New Orleans, Louisiana. We drove there in two days. I didn'tthink it would be very interesting, but I was wrong. We saw the Mississippi River, rode a horse carriage inthe French Quarter, and visited a cemetery where everyone was buried above the ground. I liked the foodbest, especially the New Orleans doughnuts called beignets.2. No one likes to eat with a dirty knife, fork, or spoon. It is important to completely wash all utensilsbefore using them. Clean utensils won't transmit germs and bacteria. They also are more pleasant to eatwith.3. Many people think poetry is old-fashioned and uninteresting. They don't realize that every time theyhear a song sung, they are hearing poetry in the form of song lyrics. Just like many written poems, manysong lyrics use rhythm, rhyme, and literary imagery. It turns out that poetry isn't old-fashioned; it's asmodern as the latest hit song.4. Growing a garden can be fun, good exercise, and will provide fresh fruits and vegetables for thegardener. It is interesting to watch the seeds pop their heads above the soil for the first time. It issometimes hard to believe that a little seed can become a large vine or plant in just a few weeks. Plantingthe seeds and pulling weeds are good exercise for anyone. Then, after watching the plant grow andproduce, the gardener ends up with delicious tomatoes, beans, or other yummy produce from the garden.5. Sometimes it is hard to fall asleep. Maybe you are not sleepy, or maybe you are thinking about whathappened during the day. You can also lie awake if a big event, like a test or a party, is happening thenext day. There are several things you can do to try and fall asleep. You can try counting sheep, or justcounting, which will keep your mind busy with a repetitious activity. Sometimes listening to soft music ogentle sounds, like rain, helps. You can even try telling yourself a story, which may distract your mindenough that you will be asleep in no time. ​</a>

It's simple to wash your hands the right way, and it usually takes no more thana minute. But did you know that simple scrub can help reduce the spread ofeverything from respiratory illness to diarrhea?Handwashing is also one of the best ways to remove germs, help avoidgetting sick, and prevent the spread of germs. So, handwashing is important toremember, and an important habit to teach your kids.For effective handwashing, follow these five steps: First, wet your handsusing clean, running water when available. Second, lather the front and back ofhands, between fingers, and under fingernails with soap. Third, scrub handstogether for at least 20 seconds. Fourth, rinse hands under clean, runningwater. Finally, dry hands completely with a clean towel, or air dry.Point of View:2. Do you love candy?" I asked my friend Roxis. I always make friends withother people.Point of View3. Daniel was nervous about going to Patricia's birthday party. He was afraid that he wouldn't know anyone but Patricia, and she would be so busy with her guests. "Mom, I don't want to go to the party." Daniel's mother furrowed her brow and said, "Daniel, we already told her we'd be there. We bought her a present. We have to go and give it to her." Daniel shook his head. He still didn't want to go. His mom put her hand on his shoulder. Point of View: 4. Pete didn't feel like doing homework. He felt like playing baseball. He grabbed his mitt off the shelf and began to fantasize about being out in the field. His fantasy was interrupted shortly by the opening of his bedroom door. It was his mom. She started to yell, "Pete, you're not failing baseball class! You're failing math class! You need to study. Put the mitt away!" Pete put the mitt away, but he didn't know the first thing about studying math. Point of View: 5. If you are confused about something in class, don't wait. Raise your hand and ask for help immediately. Do it while your teacher is still explaining the material. Your teacher will probably be happy that you are taking an active part in your education and should attempt to explain the material in a different way. If you are still confused, ask your teacher if he or she is available after class to give you additional instruction. You are worth it. Don't give up on yourself . Point of View:​</a>

1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</a>

                            9. In England once there lived a big
And wonderfully clever pig.
To everybody it was plain
That Piggy had a massive brain.
He worked out sums inside his head,
There was no book he hadn't read.
He knew what made an airplane fly,
He knew how engines worked and why.
He knew all this, but in the end
One question drove him round the bend:
He simply couldn't puzzle out
What LIFE was really all about.
What was the reason for his birth?
Why was he placed upon this earth?
His giant brain went round and round.
Alas, no answer could be found.
Till suddenly one wondrous night.
All in a flash he saw the light.
He jumped up like a ballet dancer
And yelled, 'By gum, I've got the answer! '
'They want my bacon slice by slice
'To sell at a tremendous price!
'They want my tender juicy chops
'To put in all the butcher's shops!
'They want my pork to make a roast
'And that's the part'll cost the most!
'They want my sausages in strings!
'They even want my chitterlings!
'The butcher's shop! The carving knife!
'That is the reason for my life! '
Such thoughts as these are not designed
To give a pig great peace of mind.
Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,
A pail of pigswill in his hand,
And piggy with a mighty roar,
Bashes the farmer to the floor…
Now comes the rather grisly bit
So let's not make too much of it,
Except that you must understand
That Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,
He ate him up from head to toe,
Chewing the pieces nice and slow.
It took an hour to reach the feet,
Because there was so much to eat,
And when he finished, Pig, of course,
Felt absolutely no remorse.
Slowly he scratched his brainy head
And with a little smile he said,
'I had a fairly powerful hunch
'That he might have me for his lunch.
'And so, because I feared the worst,
'I thought I'd better eat him first.'

But even Sara's mom cannot find cure for the coronavirus. “What does COVID-19 look like?- Sarah asked her mom. "COVID-19 or the Corona virus is very tiny, we can't see it," said her mom." But it spreads in the coughs and sneezes of people who are sick and when they touch people or things around them. People who are sick get a fever and cough and can have some trouble in breathing “So, we can't fight it because we can't see it, Sara asked, "We can fight it, Sara's mom answered. The virus affects many kinds of people and everyone can help fight it. Children are special and they can help too. You need to stay safe for all of us. I need you to be my hero." "Heroes have superpowers”. She said to herself closing her eyes to sleep. "I need a way to tell all children in the world how to protect everyone else, Sarah said. "I need something that can fly, something with a big voice and something that can help!" she added. Suddenly a shadow appeared in front of her. What are you? asked Sara "I'm Pedro, a flying Pegasus," it replied. "I never seen a Pegasus before. Sara whispered. “Maybe if I have you, I can tell all the children in the world about Coronavirus," said Sara. "Yes sure. Nothing can harm you when we're together," replied Pedro. Sara jumped on Pedro's back and together they soared out through her bedroom window, into the night sky. They flew towards the stars and said hello to the moon. They talked to different people around the world and told them the things they need to do to avoid spreading of coronavirus. “Wash your hands with soap and water. Instead of shaking hands, we wave to people. We try to stay inside especially for crowded city. People must stop travelling and should closed the boarders across the world. Stay at least one meter apart from each other. Isolate yourself if you are not feeling well. We should not stop taking care of one another. “Sara said. "We can do things for each other," Pedro added. Sarah fell asleep and when she woke up the next day, Pedro was gone. Sara ran to her mom with her drawing to tell her the news. “There are many heroes keeping people safe from the Corona virus, like wonderful doctors and nurses.

                            17. B. In each paragraph below, underline the key sentence and encircle at least one supporting sentence.1. The best trip my family ever took was to New Orleans, Louisiana. We drove there in two days. I didn'tthink it would be very interesting, but I was wrong. We saw the Mississippi River, rode a horse carriage inthe French Quarter, and visited a cemetery where everyone was buried above the ground. I liked the foodbest, especially the New Orleans doughnuts called beignets.2. No one likes to eat with a dirty knife, fork, or spoon. It is important to completely wash all utensilsbefore using them. Clean utensils won't transmit germs and bacteria. They also are more pleasant to eatwith.3. Many people think poetry is old-fashioned and uninteresting. They don't realize that every time theyhear a song sung, they are hearing poetry in the form of song lyrics. Just like many written poems, manysong lyrics use rhythm, rhyme, and literary imagery. It turns out that poetry isn't old-fashioned; it's asmodern as the latest hit song.4. Growing a garden can be fun, good exercise, and will provide fresh fruits and vegetables for thegardener. It is interesting to watch the seeds pop their heads above the soil for the first time. It issometimes hard to believe that a little seed can become a large vine or plant in just a few weeks. Plantingthe seeds and pulling weeds are good exercise for anyone. Then, after watching the plant grow andproduce, the gardener ends up with delicious tomatoes, beans, or other yummy produce from the garden.5. Sometimes it is hard to fall asleep. Maybe you are not sleepy, or maybe you are thinking about whathappened during the day. You can also lie awake if a big event, like a test or a party, is happening thenext day. There are several things you can do to try and fall asleep. You can try counting sheep, or justcounting, which will keep your mind busy with a repetitious activity. Sometimes listening to soft music ogentle sounds, like rain, helps. You can even try telling yourself a story, which may distract your mindenough that you will be asleep in no time. ​</h2><br />

It's simple to wash your hands the right way, and it usually takes no more thana minute. But did you know that simple scrub can help reduce the spread ofeverything from respiratory illness to diarrhea?Handwashing is also one of the best ways to remove germs, help avoidgetting sick, and prevent the spread of germs. So, handwashing is important toremember, and an important habit to teach your kids.For effective handwashing, follow these five steps: First, wet your handsusing clean, running water when available. Second, lather the front and back ofhands, between fingers, and under fingernails with soap. Third, scrub handstogether for at least 20 seconds. Fourth, rinse hands under clean, runningwater. Finally, dry hands completely with a clean towel, or air dry.Point of View:2. Do you love candy?" I asked my friend Roxis. I always make friends withother people.Point of View3. Daniel was nervous about going to Patricia's birthday party. He was afraid that he wouldn't know anyone but Patricia, and she would be so busy with her guests. "Mom, I don't want to go to the party." Daniel's mother furrowed her brow and said, "Daniel, we already told her we'd be there. We bought her a present. We have to go and give it to her." Daniel shook his head. He still didn't want to go. His mom put her hand on his shoulder. Point of View: 4. Pete didn't feel like doing homework. He felt like playing baseball. He grabbed his mitt off the shelf and began to fantasize about being out in the field. His fantasy was interrupted shortly by the opening of his bedroom door. It was his mom. She started to yell, "Pete, you're not failing baseball class! You're failing math class! You need to study. Put the mitt away!" Pete put the mitt away, but he didn't know the first thing about studying math. Point of View: 5. If you are confused about something in class, don't wait. Raise your hand and ask for help immediately. Do it while your teacher is still explaining the material. Your teacher will probably be happy that you are taking an active part in your education and should attempt to explain the material in a different way. If you are still confused, ask your teacher if he or she is available after class to give you additional instruction. You are worth it. Don't give up on yourself . Point of View:​</h2><br />

                            24. Identify the writing techniques used in the following informative essays
below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</h2><br />
