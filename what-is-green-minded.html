Dear Son,
I would like to inform you that I am happy to have the flowers in a green
ceramic pot with pebbles you gave me a week ago. I put water in it and placed it in
my window where the sunlight is enough to heat it. I am glad to tell you that there
is another flower growing near it. But before it, I noticed that several bees are
visiting the flowers regularly. Do you think it has something to do with the new and
growing plant? Or is it because of an earthworm burrowing in the soil? I know that
you have an ecological explanation for it. You don’t mind telling me, do you? Here
is the picture I took so that you can see the beauty of this flower. I will be waiting
for your response. Take care always my son.
Lovingly yours,
Mother

But friendship soon turned to love. Juana's father came to know of the love affair. He told Juana not to entairtain Aging. In spite of this, the two lovers found ways to see each other. Early one evening Juana's father arrived from the field where he had been working all day. To his surprise he saw Aging by the window of the house. The sight of Aging made the Father angry. Quickly, he reached the window and with sharp bolo, he struck Aging on the arm. Down fell the arm of Aging. Then Aging rushed out of the house, followed by Juana who kept on crying and calling Aging's name at the same time. Juana was not able to find Aging. After she had comforted herself, she went back to the house, took Aging's Arm, and buried it in the yard. The next morning Juana's father went to the garden. What did he see? Near the spot whre Juana buried Aging's Arm, there was a small green plant pushing itself up. The plant had wide green leaves and yellow fruits shaped like clusters of fingers. He shouted in surprise. Then he called Juana to come down. What is this plant?" asked the father. " I've never seen one like it before!". Upon seeing the plant, Juana remembered the arm she buried on the spot the night before. The name of Aging kept lingering on her mind. Then Juana said, "The plant is Aging! It is the arm of Aging!". From that time on, the plant with clustered fruits came to be known as Aging, which was later changed to Saging. Questions: 1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. What is the settings of the story? 3. What was the role of the Father of Juana in the story? Is he a protagonist or antagonist? Explain your answer. 4. How did Juana and Aging fight for their love to each other? 5. What happened to Aging's Arm? 6. What did you learn from the story? 3 ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>We’ve cooked rice countless times and countless ways, but we still don’t always get it right. We’ve rinsed it, soaked it, simmered it in carefully measured liquid, and boiled it in a large pot of water. We’ve cooked it with and without a lid, tried all shapes and sizes of pans, and even invested in specially designed rice cookers. Sometimes each grain is tender yet chewy, separate, and fluffy. Other times, the grains just clump together.<p></p>So how do we get our rice to behave and turn out exactly how we want it? Well, we’ve found the secret. Cooking rice perfectly is simply a matter of choosing the right variety and the right cooking method for the type of dish you want to make. It’s not rocket science, just a simple application of rice science.<br />

Dear Son,
I would like to inform you that I am happy to have the flowers in a green
ceramic pot with pebbles you gave me a week ago. I put water in it and placed it in
my window where the sunlight is enough to heat it. I am glad to tell you that there
is another flower growing near it. But before it, I noticed that several bees are
visiting the flowers regularly. Do you think it has something to do with the new and
growing plant? Or is it because of an earthworm burrowing in the soil? I know that
you have an ecological explanation for it. You don’t mind telling me, do you? Here
is the picture I took so that you can see the beauty of this flower. I will be waiting
for your response. Take care always my son.
Lovingly yours,
Mother

But friendship soon turned to love. Juana's father came to know of the love affair. He told Juana not to entairtain Aging. In spite of this, the two lovers found ways to see each other. Early one evening Juana's father arrived from the field where he had been working all day. To his surprise he saw Aging by the window of the house. The sight of Aging made the Father angry. Quickly, he reached the window and with sharp bolo, he struck Aging on the arm. Down fell the arm of Aging. Then Aging rushed out of the house, followed by Juana who kept on crying and calling Aging's name at the same time. Juana was not able to find Aging. After she had comforted herself, she went back to the house, took Aging's Arm, and buried it in the yard. The next morning Juana's father went to the garden. What did he see? Near the spot whre Juana buried Aging's Arm, there was a small green plant pushing itself up. The plant had wide green leaves and yellow fruits shaped like clusters of fingers. He shouted in surprise. Then he called Juana to come down. What is this plant?" asked the father. " I've never seen one like it before!". Upon seeing the plant, Juana remembered the arm she buried on the spot the night before. The name of Aging kept lingering on her mind. Then Juana said, "The plant is Aging! It is the arm of Aging!". From that time on, the plant with clustered fruits came to be known as Aging, which was later changed to Saging. Questions: 1. Who are the characters in the story? 2.

The principles present are repetition and symmetry.</p><p></p><p>2. The use of geometric shapes and repetition is significant to Islamic culture and tradition, as it represents the infinite nature of God and the balance and order of the universe.
