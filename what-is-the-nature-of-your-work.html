                            28. if you are a parent, is it natural that when you have a child, the child is taken directly from you and does not beg and is always with your in-laws even if you are not working. as a parent what would you say? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>As a parent, I would say that it is natural to want to have a close and loving relationship with your child, and to feel hurt and angry if someone tries to interfere with that. I would also say that it is not healthy or fair for anyone to take your child away from you without your consent or involvement, unless there is a serious risk of harm to the child.</p><p></p><p>According to some sources, parental alienation is when one parent discredits the other parent to a child or children they share, using strategies such as brainwashing, alienating, or programming. This can damage the parent-child relationship and cause the child to become estranged from the other parent. Some experts believe that parental alienation can have negative effects on the child's mental health and well-being.</p><p></p><p>If you are experiencing parental alienation, you may want to seek professional help from a therapist, a lawyer, or a mediator who can help you cope with your emotions, protect your rights, and restore your bond with your child. You may also want to communicate with your in-laws in a respectful and assertive way, setting clear boundaries and expectations about your role and involvement in your child's life.</p><p>PA BRAINLEST NAMAN PO</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Renewable energy minimizes carbon pollution and has a much lower impact on our environment. </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Wind turbines use blades to collect the wind's kinetic energy. Wind flows over the blades creating lift (similar to the effect on airplane wings), which causes the blades to turn. The blades are connected to a drive shaft that turns an electric generator, which produces (generates) electricity</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Nonrenewable resources are used to help provide humans with the energy they need to power their homes, cars, and Fourth of July barbeques</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Reduce water use by turning off faucets when not using water. Use low-flow shower heads, which save on water and use less energy. Use low-flush and composting toilets. Put kitchen and garden waste into a compost pile.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>hope</strong><strong> </strong><strong>it's</strong><strong> </strong><strong>help</strong></p><br />
