                                            Learning Task 7. Below is Donald Trump's speech on January 13, 2021 condemning violence onthe US Capitol. Read it intently and critically. Note all the blases and prejudices contained in thepiingbericsideMy follow Americans, I want to speak to you tonight about the troubling events of thepast week. As I have said, the incursion of the US Capitol struck at the very heart of ourRepublic. It ongered and appalled millions of Americans across the political spectrum. I want tobe very clear, I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence andvandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement,Making America Great Again has always been about defending the rule of law,supporting the men and women of law enforcement, and upholding our nation's most sacredtraditions and valuos, Mob violenco goes against everything I believe in and everything ourmovement stands for, No true supporter of mine could over endorse political violence. No truesupporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag. No truesupporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their follow Americans. If you do any of thesethings, you are not supporting our movement, you are attacking it and you are attacking ourcountry. We cannot tolerato it.Tragically, over the course of the past year made so difficult because of COVID-19, wehave seen political violence spiral out of control. We have seen too many riots, too many mobs,too many acts of intimidation and destruction. It must stop. Whether you are on the right or onthe left, a Democrat or a Republican, there is never a justification for violence, no excuses, noexceptions, America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last week will bebrought to justiceNow I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda to be thinking of waysto ease tensions, calm tempers, and help to promote peace in our country. There has beenreporting that additional demonstrations are being planned in the coming days, both here inWashington and across the country. I have been briefed by the US Secret Service on thepotential threats, Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful andpeaceful way. That is your First Amendment Right. But I cannot emphasize that there must beno violence, no law breaking and no vandalism of any kind,Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement. I havedirected federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order. In Washington,D.C., We are bringing in thousands of National Guard members to secure the city and ensurethat a transition can occur safely and without incident. Like all of you, I was shocked anddeeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week. I want to thank the hundreds ofmillions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm,moderation and grace, We will get through this challenge just like we always do.I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech wehave seen in recent days. These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel andblacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us tolisten to one another, not to silence one another. All of us can choose by our actions to riseabove the ranker and find common ground and shared purpose. We must focus on advancingthe interests of the whole nation, delivering the miracle vaccines, defeating the pandemic,rebuilding the economy, protecting our national security and upholding the rule of law.Today, I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment and jointogether as one American people. Let us choose to move forward united for the good of ourfarnílies, our communities, and our country. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America,dt​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>       Perla, our new neighbor was in their kitchen on the evening of  the 4th day of Novembe  2018 to prepare their supper when she heard the strong thunder lightings branging outside along with the heavy rains. With just a glimpse of her eyes outside the window, she saw mountains of huge rocks falling from the distant hills.After what she saw, she hurriedly alarmed her parents and siblings. Together they run as fast as they could without even thinking of their things inside the house. As they were several meters away from their house, a big slashing rock from the mountain top exactly hit their home. </p><p></p><p>        After what had happened, and inspite of the fact that they have lost everything, they were still very thankful to God for not letting anything happen to anyone of them. They felt very sorry to those who hidiously  lost not just their homes but even their loved ones in that disaster. From that day on, they regularly volunteer to mass works to at least pay back the favour to those strangers who wholeheartedly helped them.</p><br />

                            15. Learning Task 7. Below is Donald Trump's speech on January 13, 2021 condemning violence onthe US Capitol. Read it intently and critically. Note all the blases and prejudices contained in thepiingbericsideMy follow Americans, I want to speak to you tonight about the troubling events of thepast week. As I have said, the incursion of the US Capitol struck at the very heart of ourRepublic. It ongered and appalled millions of Americans across the political spectrum. I want tobe very clear, I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence andvandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement,Making America Great Again has always been about defending the rule of law,supporting the men and women of law enforcement, and upholding our nation's most sacredtraditions and valuos, Mob violenco goes against everything I believe in and everything ourmovement stands for, No true supporter of mine could over endorse political violence. No truesupporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag. No truesupporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their follow Americans. If you do any of thesethings, you are not supporting our movement, you are attacking it and you are attacking ourcountry. We cannot tolerato it.Tragically, over the course of the past year made so difficult because of COVID-19, wehave seen political violence spiral out of control. We have seen too many riots, too many mobs,too many acts of intimidation and destruction. It must stop. Whether you are on the right or onthe left, a Democrat or a Republican, there is never a justification for violence, no excuses, noexceptions, America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last week will bebrought to justiceNow I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda to be thinking of waysto ease tensions, calm tempers, and help to promote peace in our country. There has beenreporting that additional demonstrations are being planned in the coming days, both here inWashington and across the country. I have been briefed by the US Secret Service on thepotential threats, Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful andpeaceful way. That is your First Amendment Right. But I cannot emphasize that there must beno violence, no law breaking and no vandalism of any kind,Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement. I havedirected federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order. In Washington,D.C., We are bringing in thousands of National Guard members to secure the city and ensurethat a transition can occur safely and without incident. Like all of you, I was shocked anddeeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week. I want to thank the hundreds ofmillions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm,moderation and grace, We will get through this challenge just like we always do.I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech wehave seen in recent days. These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel andblacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us tolisten to one another, not to silence one another. All of us can choose by our actions to riseabove the ranker and find common ground and shared purpose. We must focus on advancingthe interests of the whole nation, delivering the miracle vaccines, defeating the pandemic,rebuilding the economy, protecting our national security and upholding the rule of law.Today, I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment and jointogether as one American people. Let us choose to move forward united for the good of ourfarnílies, our communities, and our country. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America,dt​</h2><br />
