                                            Read the following persuasive essay carefully. Encircle the verbs, box the adjectives, and underline the adverbs that express strong or pressing points. Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</a>

                                            Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he orshe cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 4 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate what is fact from what is faulty evidence, then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under out ignorant noses.

Thank you in adv
Here's the essay:
Cyberbullying is a recent form of aggression that students use to humiliate and attack their less popular peers. Like traditional bullying, this behavior is based on the imbalance of power between bullies and victims and may continue for a long time. Cyberbullying manifests itself in posting and sharing abusive comments, photos, and videos, writing intimidating e-mails and messages, spreading rumors, etc. (Völlink, Dehue, &amp; Guckin, 2015). Unlike face-to-face school bullying, this type of aggression may occur at any time and in any place, so the victim cannot escape it. It is also more difficult to prevent bullying and punish abusers because they often remain anonymous. Cyberbullying has a detrimental effect on victims’ emotional and psychological health, so effective solutions to this phenomenon should be introduced to protect children.
During the past decade, researchers paid increased attention to the phenomenon of cyberbullying, focusing specifically on its adverse effects on victims’ health and well-being. Findings from multiple studies have demonstrated that children subject to systematic online abuse have increased risks for experiencing depression and somatic symptoms, as well as feeling lonely and vulnerable (Nixon, 2014). These people may also have social and communication problems that persist into adulthood, and they do not feel safe at school even if no one abuses them face-to-face. Interestingly, research suggests that both victims and bullies suffer from cyberbullying, with latter being more subject to unexplained aggression and delinquent behaviors (Nixon, 2014). It means that efforts at eliminating cyberbullying and supporting children should be directed at both victims and perpetrators.
The problem of cyberbullying is extremely difficult to address. Unlike school bullying that occurs in real life and can be detected by teachers and peers, this aggressive behavior is more elusive and invisible (Minton, 2013). Students rarely report being abused on the Internet, mostly because they realize that their parents and teachers would not help them. The problem is that even when a student reports cyberbullying, it is practically impossible to identify its source and punish abusers. For now, schools lack comprehensive anti-bulling policies and cannot come up with actual strategies and tactics to tackle this growing problem. Parents also seem to lack understanding of how detrimental cyberbullying may be for their children’s health and do not know how to support them.
I strongly believe that effective solutions to cyberbullying need to be introduced. The most important thing that needs to be done is student education. Children need to understand how cyberbullying affects them and their peers and why this type of behavior is unacceptable. They also need to be encouraged to seek professional advice and support of psychologists when cyber bullying bothers them. Parents should also be educated to detect the slight changes in their children’s behavior and help them overcome their problems successfully. Both schools and parents need to make sure that children feel protected and cared for and not allow them to suffer silently. Only an integrated approach to cyberbullying involving teachers, parents, and students can bring positive, long-term effects.
Ultimately, the way schools and parents combat cyberbullying will determine students’ safety and emotional well-being. Cyberbullying is a negative social trend that affects the most vulnerable and weak children, leading to psychological and psychosomatic problems, depression, anxiety, etc. Because this phenomenon is difficult to detect and prevent, it is extremely important to involve all stakeholders including teachers, families, and students. I am convinced that a collaborative approach to dealing with cyberbullies can reduce aggressive behavior and make children feel more protected, both at home and at school.</a>

                                            DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are ef- fective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016," they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of peo- ple with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invest- ed in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smok- ing. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff. Week 10: Page 14 of 20 Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous pas- sive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age. To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there. As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their danger- ous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day be- come more obvious to them too. https://chiefessays.net/position-essay-examples-to-help-you-grasp-the-idea/ Guide Questions: 1.

                                            since the beginning of time, beauty standards have been defined and coveted. Every time standards change, the current generation’s perception of themselves does, too. For my generation, our butts aren’t big enough, our stomachs aren’t flat enough and our bodies aren’t curvy enough. For the generation before us, their hair wasn’t big enough or their butts flat enough. The common denominator is that these standards have a negative effect on those who are exposed to them. It especially affects teens and pre-teens, as they are just coming into who they are, and self-image is a large part of this. According to the Park Nicollet Melrose Center, 53 percent of thirteen-year-old American girls are unhappy with their bodies. The number increases to 78 percent by the time they reach 17.  A negative self-image can not only contribute to several mental illnesses and disorders, but problems that last a lifetime. It’s extremely hard to combat insecurity once you’ve dealt with it before. A 2010 study focused on girls ages 13 to 17 found nine out of 10 girls felt pressured by the media and fashion industries to be skinny. The media is a constant reminder of the narrow definition of what beauty has become. Places like Victoria’s Secret who denounce plus-size women who they don’t “market” to when they’re one of the biggest beauty stores in the world play a large part in this. You also have stores whose sizes run smaller than what is normal, bringing on insecure thoughts. The biggest problem is the media. Teens and pre-teens spend most of their time on social media, looking at these ridiculous body goals and looks. These images are doctored, airbrushed and usually heavily-edited. I have no problem with anyone who gets plastic surgery, but what about the girls who see those bodies and compare themselves? It’s unhealthy, at the very least. Subscribing to these images can only have a negative effect on these young women who are still growing into who they are, in a stage of their life already plagued with enough self-doubt. Magazines are not exempt from this problem. Magazines are largely digital these days, and they also utilize the various practices of editing the images they put out. In fact, magazines are the professionals at this. Magazine editors often lighten skin colors, take in hips and lengthen legs — the list goes on. American actress Zendaya was a victim of such manipulation in 2015. The singer called out Modeliste magazine for editing her body in images shot for the issue. The then 19-year-old wrote on Instagram, “Had a new shoot come out today and was shocked when I found my 19 year old hips and torso quite manipulated. These are the things that make women self conscious, that create the unrealistic ideals of beauty that we have.” The images are not without implications at all, and it’s irresponsible for those charged with creating the current images of beauty to keep putting them out. Why publish an image of someone who doesn’t even look like the image? It only helps to foster unhealthy thought processes, low self-esteem and problems for people growing up alongside them. make a reflection essay of that story​</a>

Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</h2><br />

                            5. Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he orshe cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 4 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate what is fact from what is faulty evidence, then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under out ignorant noses.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Why is Education Important in Our Society:<p>One of the benefits of education is that the educational system teaches us how to obtain and develop critical and logical thinking and make independent decisions. When children become adults, they are faced with a lot of challenging issues – pay off your student loans, get a job, buy a car and a house, provide for your family, etc. However, if one has spent years educating themselves, they should be able to make sound decisions on these various quandaries. Not only are people able to form their own opinions, but they are also good at finding solid and reliable arguments and evidence to back up and confirm their decisions. !!</p><br />

                            7. What are the 3 claims in ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAY ON CYBERBULLYING.
Thank you in adv
Here's the essay:
Cyberbullying is a recent form of aggression that students use to humiliate and attack their less popular peers. Like traditional bullying, this behavior is based on the imbalance of power between bullies and victims and may continue for a long time. Cyberbullying manifests itself in posting and sharing abusive comments, photos, and videos, writing intimidating e-mails and messages, spreading rumors, etc. (Völlink, Dehue, &amp; Guckin, 2015). Unlike face-to-face school bullying, this type of aggression may occur at any time and in any place, so the victim cannot escape it. It is also more difficult to prevent bullying and punish abusers because they often remain anonymous. Cyberbullying has a detrimental effect on victims’ emotional and psychological health, so effective solutions to this phenomenon should be introduced to protect children.
During the past decade, researchers paid increased attention to the phenomenon of cyberbullying, focusing specifically on its adverse effects on victims’ health and well-being. Findings from multiple studies have demonstrated that children subject to systematic online abuse have increased risks for experiencing depression and somatic symptoms, as well as feeling lonely and vulnerable (Nixon, 2014). These people may also have social and communication problems that persist into adulthood, and they do not feel safe at school even if no one abuses them face-to-face. Interestingly, research suggests that both victims and bullies suffer from cyberbullying, with latter being more subject to unexplained aggression and delinquent behaviors (Nixon, 2014). It means that efforts at eliminating cyberbullying and supporting children should be directed at both victims and perpetrators.
The problem of cyberbullying is extremely difficult to address. Unlike school bullying that occurs in real life and can be detected by teachers and peers, this aggressive behavior is more elusive and invisible (Minton, 2013). Students rarely report being abused on the Internet, mostly because they realize that their parents and teachers would not help them. The problem is that even when a student reports cyberbullying, it is practically impossible to identify its source and punish abusers. For now, schools lack comprehensive anti-bulling policies and cannot come up with actual strategies and tactics to tackle this growing problem. Parents also seem to lack understanding of how detrimental cyberbullying may be for their children’s health and do not know how to support them.
I strongly believe that effective solutions to cyberbullying need to be introduced. The most important thing that needs to be done is student education. Children need to understand how cyberbullying affects them and their peers and why this type of behavior is unacceptable. They also need to be encouraged to seek professional advice and support of psychologists when cyber bullying bothers them. Parents should also be educated to detect the slight changes in their children’s behavior and help them overcome their problems successfully. Both schools and parents need to make sure that children feel protected and cared for and not allow them to suffer silently. Only an integrated approach to cyberbullying involving teachers, parents, and students can bring positive, long-term effects.
Ultimately, the way schools and parents combat cyberbullying will determine students’ safety and emotional well-being. Cyberbullying is a negative social trend that affects the most vulnerable and weak children, leading to psychological and psychosomatic problems, depression, anxiety, etc. Because this phenomenon is difficult to detect and prevent, it is extremely important to involve all stakeholders including teachers, families, and students. I am convinced that a collaborative approach to dealing with cyberbullies can reduce aggressive behavior and make children feel more protected, both at home and at school.</h2><br />

                            10. DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are ef- fective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016," they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of peo- ple with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invest- ed in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smok- ing. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff. Week 10: Page 14 of 20 Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous pas- sive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age. To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there. As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their danger- ous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day be- come more obvious to them too. https://chiefessays.net/position-essay-examples-to-help-you-grasp-the-idea/ Guide Questions: 1.

                            11. since the beginning of time, beauty standards have been defined and coveted. Every time standards change, the current generation’s perception of themselves does, too. For my generation, our butts aren’t big enough, our stomachs aren’t flat enough and our bodies aren’t curvy enough. For the generation before us, their hair wasn’t big enough or their butts flat enough. The common denominator is that these standards have a negative effect on those who are exposed to them. It especially affects teens and pre-teens, as they are just coming into who they are, and self-image is a large part of this. According to the Park Nicollet Melrose Center, 53 percent of thirteen-year-old American girls are unhappy with their bodies. The number increases to 78 percent by the time they reach 17.  A negative self-image can not only contribute to several mental illnesses and disorders, but problems that last a lifetime. It’s extremely hard to combat insecurity once you’ve dealt with it before. A 2010 study focused on girls ages 13 to 17 found nine out of 10 girls felt pressured by the media and fashion industries to be skinny. The media is a constant reminder of the narrow definition of what beauty has become. Places like Victoria’s Secret who denounce plus-size women who they don’t “market” to when they’re one of the biggest beauty stores in the world play a large part in this. You also have stores whose sizes run smaller than what is normal, bringing on insecure thoughts. The biggest problem is the media. Teens and pre-teens spend most of their time on social media, looking at these ridiculous body goals and looks. These images are doctored, airbrushed and usually heavily-edited. I have no problem with anyone who gets plastic surgery, but what about the girls who see those bodies and compare themselves? It’s unhealthy, at the very least. Subscribing to these images can only have a negative effect on these young women who are still growing into who they are, in a stage of their life already plagued with enough self-doubt. Magazines are not exempt from this problem. Magazines are largely digital these days, and they also utilize the various practices of editing the images they put out. In fact, magazines are the professionals at this. Magazine editors often lighten skin colors, take in hips and lengthen legs — the list goes on. American actress Zendaya was a victim of such manipulation in 2015. The singer called out Modeliste magazine for editing her body in images shot for the issue. The then 19-year-old wrote on Instagram, “Had a new shoot come out today and was shocked when I found my 19 year old hips and torso quite manipulated. These are the things that make women self conscious, that create the unrealistic ideals of beauty that we have.” The images are not without implications at all, and it’s irresponsible for those charged with creating the current images of beauty to keep putting them out. Why publish an image of someone who doesn’t even look like the image? It only helps to foster unhealthy thought processes, low self-esteem and problems for people growing up alongside them. make a reflection essay of that story​</h2><br />
