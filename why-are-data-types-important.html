                            5. Why is it important to learn the proper way of declaring and using data types and variables ?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Data types are especially important in Java because it is a strongly typed language. This means that all operations are type-checked by the compiler for type compatibility. Illegal operations will not be compiled. Thus, strong type checking helps prevent errors and enhances reliability. To enable strong type checking, all variables, expressions, and values have a type. There is no concept of a “type-less” variable, for example. Furthermore, the type of a value determines what operations are allowed on it. An operation allowed on one type might not be allowed on another.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The choice of sampling method in selecting respondents depends on the research question, the population of interest, and the available resources. Common sampling methods include simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, and purposive sampling.</p><p>Yes, respondents are vital in a research study because they provide the data needed to answer the research questions. The selection of appropriate respondents can affect the validity and reliability of the study.</p><p>Yes, it is important to plan the procedures ahead of the actual gathering of data to ensure that the research is conducted efficiently and effectively. Planning can also help to identify potential problems and address them before they occur.</p><p>Researchers make their own research instrument after they have defined the research questions and objectives. They then select the appropriate method of data collection, design the instrument, and pilot test it to ensure that it is valid and reliable.</p><p>Before the research instrument is administered to the respondents, researchers should ensure that it is clear, easy to understand, and free of bias.

Why is important to keep integrity of data that are store and entered in the database?4. What are the types of relationship in MS Access? Describe each relationship?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a relational database, relationships enable you to prevent redundant data. For example, if you are designing a database that will track information about books, you might have a table named "Titles" that stores information about each book, such as the book's title, date of publication, and publisher. There is also information that you might want to store about the publisher, such as the publisher's telephone number, address, and ZIP Code/Postal Code. If you were to store all this information in the "Titles" table, the publisher's telephone number would be duplicated for each title that the publisher prints.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A better solution is to store the publisher's information only one time, in a separate table that we will call "Publishers." You would then put a pointer in the "Titles" table that references an entry in the "Publishers" table.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To make sure that you data stays synchronized, you can enforce referential integrity between tables. Referential integrity relationships help make sure that information in one table matches information in another. For example, each title in the "Titles" table must be associated with a specific publisher in the "Publishers" table. A title cannot be added to the database for a publisher that does not exist in the database.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Logical relationships in a database enable you to efficiently query data and create reports.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>That,s it</p><p> </p><p>Can you mark me pls gonna need it</p><br />
