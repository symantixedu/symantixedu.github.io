Student Opinion: Zoos should be banned by Megan Zhou (Adapted by Newsela Staff) Published on July 16, 2020 Do you think zoos are nice places for animals to live? If you do, think again. Zoos are harmful to animals. There are three main reasons why. First, zoos breed animals inhumanely. Second, they do not help animals return to the wild. Third, they do not take good enough care of the animals. For these reasons, zoos should be shut down and banned, or stopped altogether. The first reason zoos should be banned is that they breed captive animals. Zoos breed animals so hat they will have baby animals to show the public. Most zoo animals are born inside zoos. Many are aised without ever seeing their original, wild homes. When zoos have too many animals, they do not return them to the wild. They simply kill the "extra" animals. Take this example from 2014. The Copenhagen Zoo is located in Denmark, a country in northern Europe. A giraffe there named Marius was raised as a baby in the zoo. He was loved by the public. Yet, when he became an adult, he was killed. The zoo's staff shot him. They didn't think he would be useful. They had other male giraffes they could breed instead of Marius.. Baby animals attract more visitors than older animals. Killing an adult animal opens up space and esources to bring in a younger animal. That animal can draw bigger crowds and more money. That is the eal reason Marius was killed. The zoo made less money as he grew up. People were more interested in Marius when he was baby than when he became an adult. The second reason zoos should be banned is that they rarely help endangered animals return to heir original habitats. A report by National Geographic found that most zoos do not have any contact with introduction programs. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is a nonprofit organization that fights for nimal rights. According to them, fewer than one-fifth of the animals in United States zoos are actually ndangered. When animal species is endangered, it is at risk of dying out completely. Zoos spend tons of money building enclosures for animals. Yet, they do almost nothing to restore wild habitats or to stop oaching in wild environments. Finally, zoos simply do not have enough resources to properly house the creatures that live there. Vild habitats cannot be remade in spaces where animals are held captive. An opinion article called "All e Reasons Why Zoos Should Be Banned" was published by Vice in 2015. It said polar bears in zoos ave up to 18,000 times less space than they do in the wild. Animals cannot be healthy in zoos. Seventy-five percent of elephants kept in zoos are overweight cording to the article. Forty percent of lion cubs pass away before their full life span. This data support e argument that zoos do not have the resources to support animals' well-being, health and populations. he British Broadcasting Company (BBC) has reported that around 3,000 to 5,000 animals are killed eac ar in zoos in Europe. Many more animals show signs of zoochosis. This is a psychological disorder served in zoo animals that leads to pacing, bar biting and other repeated behaviors. Zoos should make an effort to reintroduce the animals they own into natural habitats. Some coul returned to the wild. However, many zoo animals would not be able to survive in the wild. These imals should then be sent to sanctuaries where they can live peacefully. Zoos inhumanely source and breed animals. They do little to improve wildlife populations. Zoos -o do little to help the public understand their impact on wildlife. Also, they cannot provide what is eded to support animals' lives. Zoos should reintroduce their animals into the wild or into sanctuary tings. This will have the added benefit of relieving zoos of the burden of keeping these animals alive n't that a win-win?​</a>

                                            Directions: Read and reflect on the short essay then answer the guide questions on a separate sheet of paper.          Man as a Social Animal        By Ma. Teresa B. Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</a>

                            11. Read the text carefully. Evaluate the claims with the writer's logos, ethos, and pathos. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. Student Opinion: Zoos should be banned by Megan Zhou (Adapted by Newsela Staff) Published on July 16, 2020 Do you think zoos are nice places for animals to live? If you do, think again. Zoos are harmful to animals. There are three main reasons why. First, zoos breed animals inhumanely. Second, they do not help animals return to the wild. Third, they do not take good enough care of the animals. For these reasons, zoos should be shut down and banned, or stopped altogether. The first reason zoos should be banned is that they breed captive animals. Zoos breed animals so hat they will have baby animals to show the public. Most zoo animals are born inside zoos. Many are aised without ever seeing their original, wild homes. When zoos have too many animals, they do not return them to the wild. They simply kill the "extra" animals. Take this example from 2014. The Copenhagen Zoo is located in Denmark, a country in northern Europe. A giraffe there named Marius was raised as a baby in the zoo. He was loved by the public. Yet, when he became an adult, he was killed. The zoo's staff shot him. They didn't think he would be useful. They had other male giraffes they could breed instead of Marius.. Baby animals attract more visitors than older animals. Killing an adult animal opens up space and esources to bring in a younger animal. That animal can draw bigger crowds and more money. That is the eal reason Marius was killed. The zoo made less money as he grew up. People were more interested in Marius when he was baby than when he became an adult. The second reason zoos should be banned is that they rarely help endangered animals return to heir original habitats. A report by National Geographic found that most zoos do not have any contact with introduction programs. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is a nonprofit organization that fights for nimal rights. According to them, fewer than one-fifth of the animals in United States zoos are actually ndangered. When animal species is endangered, it is at risk of dying out completely. Zoos spend tons of money building enclosures for animals. Yet, they do almost nothing to restore wild habitats or to stop oaching in wild environments. Finally, zoos simply do not have enough resources to properly house the creatures that live there. Vild habitats cannot be remade in spaces where animals are held captive. An opinion article called "All e Reasons Why Zoos Should Be Banned" was published by Vice in 2015. It said polar bears in zoos ave up to 18,000 times less space than they do in the wild. Animals cannot be healthy in zoos. Seventy-five percent of elephants kept in zoos are overweight cording to the article. Forty percent of lion cubs pass away before their full life span. This data support e argument that zoos do not have the resources to support animals' well-being, health and populations. he British Broadcasting Company (BBC) has reported that around 3,000 to 5,000 animals are killed eac ar in zoos in Europe. Many more animals show signs of zoochosis. This is a psychological disorder served in zoo animals that leads to pacing, bar biting and other repeated behaviors. Zoos should make an effort to reintroduce the animals they own into natural habitats. Some coul returned to the wild. However, many zoo animals would not be able to survive in the wild. These imals should then be sent to sanctuaries where they can live peacefully. Zoos inhumanely source and breed animals. They do little to improve wildlife populations. Zoos -o do little to help the public understand their impact on wildlife. Also, they cannot provide what is eded to support animals' lives. Zoos should reintroduce their animals into the wild or into sanctuary tings. This will have the added benefit of relieving zoos of the burden of keeping these animals alive n't that a win-win?​</h2><br />
                        <p>In this text, the writer uses logos by providing factual information, such as the National Geographic report and the statistics about the space polar bears have in zoos compared to the wild. The writer also uses ethos by citing sources such as PETA and the BBC to support their argument. Finally, the writer uses pathos by evoking emotion through their description of the death of Marius the giraffe and the psychological effects of captivity on zoo animals.</p><br />

Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Yes, I believe that man is a social animal because humans have a natural instinct to live in society with other human beings.</p><p></p><p>2. Man becomes a social animal by forming social groups with common interests and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background, and other personal qualities.</p><p></p><p>3. Human interaction is very important in building a nation because it helps people form social groups that can work together towards common goals.</p><p></p><br />

Imagine you are reading a book for school. You need to find important details that you can use for an assignment. However, when you begin to read, you notice that the book has very little punctuation. The sentences fail to form complete paragraphs and instead form one block of text without clear organization.

Without clear and concise sentences, it is difficult to find the information you need.</p><p></p><p>For both students and professionals, clear communication is important. Whether you are typing an email or writing a report or essay, it is your responsibility as the writer to present your thoughts and ideas clearly and precisely. Writing in complete sentences is one way to ensure that you communicate well. This section covers how to recognize and write basic sentence structures and how to avoid some common writing errors.</p><p></p><p>Components of a Sentence</p><p>Clearly written, complete sentences require key information: a subject, a verb and a complete idea. A sentence needs to make sense on its own. Sometimes, complete sentences are also called independent clauses. A clause is a group of words that may make up a sentence. An independent clause is a group of words that may stand alone as a complete, grammatically correct thought. The following sentences show independent clauses.</p><p></p><p>Independent Clause: We went to the store. Independent clause: We bought the ingredients on our list, and then (independent clause): we went home.</p><p></p><p>All complete sentences have at least one independent clause. You can identify an independent clause by reading it on its own and looking for the subject and the verb.</p><p></p><p>Subjects</p><br />
